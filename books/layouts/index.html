                            Traditionally, we use Languages and Frameworks interact with Relational Databases. 
                            While these are effective in many ways, One problem is that, each of these brings new learning curve. 
                            It will be nice if we use SQL itself as the core skill and build application with plain simple SQL skills. 
                            In this webinar, our very own Sathis will demo this approach with a case study that builds simple, high performing Java application using Postgres database.
