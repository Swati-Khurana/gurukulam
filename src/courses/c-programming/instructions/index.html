              <ul>
                  <li>C instruction are the commands in the program
                      that instructs that compiler to do certain action.  
                  </li>
                  <li>Basically it gives the instruction to the compiler on 
                      how to achive the goals of the progrm.</li>
                  <li>For example,when we add two numbers,the C
                      compiler will not understand how to do it.
                      but if we the write same in terms of code /
                      command using arithmatic operater'+'And
                      numbers or variable,it gives meaningful
                      information to the compiler on how to get the 
                      sum.</li>

              <h3>TYPES OF INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
          </section>
          <section>
              <ul>
                  <li>Ther are basically three types of instruction in C:</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Type Declaration Instruction – To declare the
                          type of variables used in a C program.</li>
                      <li>Arithmetic Instruction – To perform arithmetic 
                          operations between constants and variables.</li>
                      <li>Control Instruction – To control the sequence 
                          of execution of various statements in a C 
                          program.</li>
                          </ul>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>TYPE DECLARATION INSTRUCTIONS
            </h3>
          </section>
          <section>
              <ul>
                  <li>These instruction inform the compiler about the
                      type of variable used.
                  </li>
                  <li>That means,whenever a variables is used in the 
                      programe,we have to specify what types of data it
                      can hold-like integer,float,double,character etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>This makes the compiler to share only those
                      specify types of values in it.
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, a variable intVar1 declared as int will 
                accept and store only integer values.</li>
            <li>It will never accept float or character values.</li>
            <li>Declaration of variable is done at the beginning,
                inside the main function.
            </li>
            <li>This function is the starting point of any C program
                and all the variable used with main function 
                needs to be declare at the beginning of it,before
                using in the function.
            </li>  
            <li>Any other function in the program can also have
                variable and they needs to be declared at the 
                beginning of respective functions.
            </li>
        </ul>    
          </section>
          <section>
        <ul>
            <li><u><b>For Example</b></u></li>
            <ul>
                <li>int a;</li>
                <li>When we declare any variable at that time we 
                    are also eligible to initialize this variable.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>int i=5,j=7;</li>
                        <li>float a=5.5;</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>when we declare and initialize variable
                    together the issue of ordering occurs.
                    sometime order of declartion matters and
                    sometime not.
                </li>    
                <ul>
                    <li>int i=10,j=25;</li>
                    <li>float b=a+3.1,a=1.5;</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>ARITHMATIC INSTRUCTION</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
        <ul>    
            <li>An Arithmetic instruction consists of a variable
                name on the left hand side of equal to (=) and
                variable names & condition on the right hand sideof equal to(=).
            </li>
            <li>The variables and constants appearing on the 
                right hand side of equal to(=) are connected by
                arithmatic operators like +,-,*,and/.
            </li>
            <li>For Example:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sum=10+20+30;</li>
                <li>avg=(a+b+c+num)/4;</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

            <h3>CONTROL INSTRUCTION</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'Control Instruction' enable us to specify the 
                    order in which the various instruction in a 
                    program are to be executed by the computer.
                </li>
                <li>In other words the control instruction determine 
                    the 'flow of control'in a program.
                </li>
                <li>There are four types of control instruction in C 
                    They are:-
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>sequence Control instruction</li>
                    <li>Selection or decision control Instruction</li>
                    <li>Repetition or Loop Control Instruction</li>
                    <li>Case Control Instruction</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
