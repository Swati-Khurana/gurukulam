          <section>
            <ul>
              <li>In C, Pointers are very easy to learn and the 
                concept of pointers is one of the most 
                powerful fundamentals of C language.</li>
              <li> Some C programming Task as are performed more
                easly with Pointers & other task such as dymnamic
                memory location cannnot performed without using
                Ponters. 
              </li>
              <li>So it become necessary to lerarn Pointers to
                become a perfect C programmer.
              </li>
              <li>Actually,Pointers are very intresting & easy to
                learn.And is widely used in C&C++ 
                Programming 
                </li>

             <ul>
               <li>A pointer is a variable whose value is the address
                 of another variable i.e.direct address of the
                 memory location.
               </li>
               <li>Like any variable or constant,we must declare a
                  pointer before using it to store any variable
                  address.
               </li>
               <li>Pointer is a striking and most powerful feature of C
                 Programming.As the name itself suggest a
                 pointer is something that points something.
               </li>
               <li>It can also described as avariable that points to
                 an ordinary variable of any type by holding  the  
                 address of that variable. 
               </li>
             </ul>
          </section>    
          <section>
            <h4><u>Consider following declration</u></h4>
            <ul>
              <li>int x=1</li>
              <li>Above declaration reverses a memory block with
                name x and its vale 1. </li>
              <li>Assume thatx is located at address 7000.</li>
              <li>There:&x=address of x=7000</li>
              <li>Then,the Pointer is represnted with*symbol., as
                *x.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section> <h3>POINTER DECLARATION</h3></section>
          <section>
            <u>The general fprm pointer variables delaration is:</u>
           <ul>
            <li><b>type*var-name;</b></li>
            <li>In this,the type is pointer base type.</li>
            <li>it must be a valid C data type & var-name is the 
              name of the pointer variable.
            </li>
            <li>And in thish satement the asterisk (*) is used to
              designate variable is a pointer.
            </li>
            <li>Just take at  look at some of the valid pointer
              declaration:
            </li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
