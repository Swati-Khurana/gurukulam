#### 5.1 s-Block Elements:

       The elements belonging to the group 1 and 2 in the modern periodic table are called
s-block elements. The elements belonging to these two groups are commonly known as
alkali and alkaline earth metals respectively. In this unit, we study their properties, uses,
important compounds and biological importance.

#### 5.2 Alkali metals:

         The word “alkali” is derived from the word al-qalīy meaning the plant ashes,
referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burnt plant
ashes, called potash contain mainly potassium carbonate. Alkali metal group consists
of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium. They are
all metals, generally soft and highly reactive. They form oxides and hydroxides and these
compounds are basic in nature.

##### 5.2.1 General characteristics of alkali metals:

       Alkali metals are highly reactive and are found in nature only as compounds.
Rubidium and caesium are found associated in minute quantities with minerals of other
alkali metals. Francium is radioactive and does not occur appreciably in nature. Francium
is highly radioactive; its longest-lived isotope has a half-life of only 21 minutes.

   **Table 5.1 Abundance of important alkali metals and their sources**

| Elements 	| Abundance inearth crust (%) 	| RelativeAbundance 	| Mineral source 	|

| Cesium 	| 0.00026 	| 46 	| by product of lithium processing) 	|

##### Electronic configuration

The general valence shell electronic configuration of alkali metals is ns^2 ,where ‘n’
represents the period number.


**Table 5.2 Electronic configuration of alkali metals**

| Element 	| Symbol 	| Atomic No. 	| Electronic configuration 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Lithium 	| Li 	| 3 	| [He]2s1 	|
| Sodium 	| Na 	| 11 	| [Ne]3s1 	|
| Potassium 	| K 	| 19 	| [Ar]4s1 	|
| Rubidium 	| Rb 	| 37 	| [Kr]5s1 	|
| Caesium 	| Cs 	| 55 	| [Xe]6s1 	|
| Francium 	| Fr 	| 87 	| [Rn]7s1 	|

##### Common oxidation state

     All these elements are highly electropositive in nature. They readily lose their valence
electron to give monovalent cations (M+). Alkali metals have only one oxidation state which is +1.

##### Atomic and ionic radii

     Being the first element of each period, alkali metals have the largest atomic and
ionic radii in their respective periods. On moving down the group, there is an increase in
the number of shells and, therefore, atomic and ionic radii increase. The monovalent ions
(M+) are smaller than the respective parent atoms as expected.

Table 5.3 Physical properties of alkali metals

| Physical property 	| Li            	| Na          	| K          	| Rb          	| Cs           	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Atomic radius / Metallic radius (Å) 	| 1.52 	| 1.86 	| 2.27 	| 2.48 	| 2.65 	|
| Ionic radius (Å) 	| 0.76 	| 1.02 	| 1.38 	| 1.52 	| 1.67 	|

| Hydration enthalpy (kJ mol-1) 	| -506 	| -406 	| -330 	| -310 	| -276 	|

##### Ionisation enthalpy

 Alkali metals have the lowest
ionisation enthalpy compared to other
elements present in the respective period.
As we go down the group, the ionisation
enthalpy decreases due to the increase
in atomic size. In addition, the number
of inner shells also increases, which in
turn increases the magnitude of screening
effect and consequently, the ionisation
enthalpy decreases down the group.

The second ionisation enthalpies of
alkali metals are very high. The removal
of an electron from the alkali metals
gives monovalent cations having stable
electronic configurations similar to the
noble gas. Therefore, it becomes very
difficult to remove the second electron
from the stable configurations already
attained.

##### Hydration enthalpy

**Electronegativity:**

 Alkali metals have comparatively
smaller value of electronegativity than the
other elements in the respective period.
When they react with other elements,
they usually produce ionic compounds.
For example, they react with halogens to
form ionic halides.

**Flame colour and the spectra:**

When the alkali metal salts
moistened with concentrated hydrochloric
acid are heated on a platinum wire in a
flame, they show characteristic coloured
flame as shown below.

Table 5.4 Flame colour and wavelength

| Element 	| Colour 	| Wavelength Wavelength  (nm)      	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Lithium 	| Crimson red 	| 670.8 	|
| Sodium 	| Yellow 	| 589.2 	|
| Potassium 	| Lilac (violet) 	| 766.5 	|
| Rubidium 	| Reddish violet 	| 780.0 	|
| Caesium 	| Blue 	| 455.5 	|

The heat in the flame excites the
valence electron to a higher energy level.
When it drops back to its actual energy
level, the excess energy is emitted as light,
whose wavelength is in the visible region
as shown in the above table.

**5.2.2 Distinctive behavior of lithium**

The distinctive behaviour of Li+ ion is due to its exceptionally small size, high polarising
power, high hydration energy and non availability of d-orbitals.

**Table 5.5 Comparison of properties of lithium with other elements of the group:**


| **Lithium** 	| **Other elements of the family**              	|
|---	|---	|
| Hard, high melting and boiling point 	| Soft and Lower melting and boiling point 	|
| Least reactive (For example it reacts with oxygen to form <br>normal oxide, forms peroxides with great difficulty<br>and its higher oxides are unstable) 	| More reactive 	|
| Reacts with nitrogen to give Li3N <br>6Li + N2 --> 2Li3N 	| No reaction 	|
| Reacts with bromine slowly 	| React violently 	|
| Reacts directly with carbon to form ionic carbides.<br>For example 2Li + 2C --> Li2C2 	| Do not react with carbon directly, <br>but can react with carbon compounds.<br>2Na + C2 H2 --> Na_2C_2+H_2 	|
| Lithium nitrate decomposes to give an oxide 	| Decompose to give nitrites 	|

**Table 5.6 Similarities between lithium and Magnesium**

| S.No. 	| Properties                       	|
|---	|---	|
| 1 	| Both lithium and magnesium are harder than other elements in the respective groups 	|
| 2 	| Lithium and magnesium react slowly with water. Their oxides and hydroxides are much less<br>soluble and their hydroxides decompose on heating. 	|
| 3 	| Both form a nitride, Li3N and Mg3N2, by direct combination with nitrogen 	|
| 4 	| They do not give any superoxides and form only oxides, Li2O and MgO 	|
| 5 	| The carbonates of lithium and magnesium decompose upon heating to form their respective<br>oxides and CO2. 	|
| 6 	| Lithium and magnesium do not form bicarbonates. 	|
| 7 	| Both LiCl and MgCl2<br><br>are soluble in ethanol and are deliquescent. They crystallise from aqueoussolution as hydrates, <br>LiCl·2H2O and MgCl2·8H2O 	|

**Diagonal Relationship:**

Similarity between the first member of group 1 (Li) and the diagonally placed
second element of group 2 (Mg) is called diagonal relationship. It is due to similar
size \\ (r_Li+)\\ = 0.766 Å and rMg2+ = 0.72 Å) and comparable electronegativity values
(Li = 1.0; Mg = 1.2).

#### 5.2.3 Chemical properties of alkali metals

Alkali metals exhibit high chemical
reactivity. The reactivity of alkali metals
increases from Li to Cs, since the ionisation
energy decreases down the group. All
alkali metals are highly reactive towards
the more electronegative elements such as
oxygen and halogens. Some characteristic
chemical properties of alkali metals are
described below.

**Reaction with oxygen**

All the alkali metals on exposure
to air or oxygen burn vigorously, forming
oxides on their surface. Lithium forms only
monoxide, sodium forms the monoxide
and peroxide and the other elements form
monoxide, peroxide, and superoxides.
These oxides are basic in nature.
 * 1.
 * 2.
 * 3.
 * 4.

**Reaction with hydrogen**

All alkali metals react with
hydrogen at about 673 K (lithium at
1073 K) to form the corresponding ionic
hydrides. Reactivity of alkali metals with
hydrogen decreases from Li to Cs.
 * 1.
 * 2.

The ionic character of the hydrides
increases from Li to Cs and their stability
decreases. The hydrides behave as strongreducing agents and their reducing nature
increases down the group.

**Reaction with halogen**

Alkali metals combine readily
with halogens to form ionic halides MX.
Reactivity of alkali metals with halogens
increases down the group because of
corresponding decrease in ionisation
enthalpy.

- 1.

- 2.

   All metal halides are ionic crystals.
However Lithium iodide shows covalent
character, as it is the smallest cation that
exerts high polarising power on the iodide
anion. Additionally, the iodide ion being
the largest can be polarised to a greater
extent by Li+ ion.

**Reaction with liquid ammonia:**

Alkali metals dissolve in liquid
ammonia to give deep blue solutions
that are conducting in nature. The
conductivity is similar to that of pure
metals (The specific conductivity of Hg is
104
Ω-1 and for sodium in liquid ammonia
is 0.5 x 104Ω-1). This happens because the
alkali metal atom readily loses its valence
electron in ammonia solution. Both the
cation and the electron are ammoniated to
give ammoniated cation and ammoniated
electron.

1.
2.

The blue colour of the solution is
due to the ammoniated electron which
absorbs energy in the visible region of
light and thus imparts blue colour to the
solution. The solutions are paramagnetic
and on standing slowly liberate hydrogen
resulting in the formation of an amide.

1.

In concentrated solution, the blue colour
changes to bronze colour and become
diamagnetic.

**Reaction with water:**
Alkali metals react with water to
give corresponding hydroxides with the
liberation of hydrogen.

1.

They also react with alcohol, and
alkynes which contain active hydrogens.
1.
2.
3.
4.

**Reducing activity:**

Alkali metals can lose their valence
electron readily hence they act as good
reducing agents.

1.

**Reaction with carbon:**

Lithium directly reacts with carbon
to form the ionic compound, lithium
carbide. Other metals do not react with
carbon directly. However, when they are
treated with compounds like acetylene
they form acetelydes.
2 Li + 2C → \\ (Li_2C_2) \\ 

**5.2.4 Uses of alkali metals:**

i. Lithium metal is used to make useful
alloys. For example with lead it is
used to make ‘white metal’ bearings
for motor engines, with aluminium
to make aircraft parts, and with
magnesium to make armour plates. It
is used in thermonuclear reactions.

ii. Lithium is also used to make
electrochemical cells.

iii. Sodium is used to make Na/Pb alloy
needed to make Pb(Et)4
and Pb(Me)4
These organolead compounds were
earlier used as anti-knock additives to
petrol, but nowadays lead-free petrol
in use.

iv. Liquid sodium metal is used as
a coolant in fast breeder nuclear
reactors.

v. Potassium has a vital role in biological
systems.Potassium chloride is used as
a fertilizer.

vii. Caesium is used in devising
photoelectric cells.

**5.3 General characteristics of the compounds of alkali metals**

All the common compounds of the
alkali metals are generally ionic in nature.
General characteristics of some of their
compounds are discussed here.

**Oxides and Hydroxides**

On combustion in excess of air,
alkali metals forms normal oxides with
formula M2O. They react with water to
form corresponding hydroxides which are
basic in nature.

1. M2O + H2O → 2 MOH

Alkali metals apart from lithium
form peroxides in addition to normal
oxides upon combustion with excess air.
These peroxides produce hydroxides and
H2O2 upon reacting with water.

1.M2O2+2 H2O → 2MOH+H2O2

2.(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

Except lithium and sodium, all
the other alkali metals form superoxides
also. These superoxides also gives basic
hydroxides upon treatment with water.

1.2 MO2+ 2 H2O → 2 MOH + H2O2+ O2

2.(M = K, Rb, Cs)

Under appropriate conditions pure
compounds M2O, M2O2or MO2may be
prepared.

**Properties of oxides and hydroxides:**

The oxides and the peroxides are
colourless when pure, but the superoxides
are yellow or orange in colour. The
peroxides are diamagnetic while the
superoxides are paramagnetic. Sodium
peroxide is widely used as an oxidising
agent. The hydroxides which are obtained
by the reaction of the oxides with water
are all white crystalline solids. The alkali
metal hydroxides are strong bases. Theydissolve in water with evolution of heat on
account of intense hydration.

**Halides:**

The alkali metal halides, MX,
(X=F, Cl, Br, I) are colourless crystalline
solids with high melting points. They
can be prepared by the reaction of the
appropriate oxide, hydroxide or carbonate
with aqueous hydrohalic acid (HX). As the
electropositive character of alkali metal
increases from Li to Cs, the ease with
which the metals form halides increases
from Li to Cs. All halides are ionic in
nature except LiBr and LiI. Except LiF,
all other halides are soluble in water. The
low solubility of LiF in water is due to its
high lattice enthalpy (small size of Li+ and
F-). Due to the presence of covalent nature
both LiBr and LiI are soluble in organic
solvents.

**Salts of oxo-acids**

1.Alkali metals form salts with all the
oxo-acids. Most of these salts are soluble
in water and are thermally stable. As the
electropositive character increases down
the group, the stability of the carbonates
and bicarbonates increases. This is due to
the decrease in polarising power of alkali
metal cations. The carbonates (M2CO3) of
alkali metals are remarkably stable up
to 1273 K, above which they first melt
and then eventually decompose to form
oxides. However, Li2CO3is considerably
less stable and decomposes readily.

1.

This is presumably due to large size
difference between Li+ and CO3-2 which
makes the crystal lattice unstable. Being
strongly basic, alkali metals except lithium
form solid bicarbonates. No other metal
forms solid bicarbonates.

1.M2CO3+ CO2+ H2O → 2 MHCO3

2.(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

All the carbonates and bicarbonates
are soluble in water and their solubilities
increase rapidly on descending the group.
This is due to the reason that lattice
energies decrease more rapidly than their
hydration energies on moving down the
group.

**5.3.1 Important compounds of alkali metals:**

**Sodium Carbonate Na2 CO3.10H2O (Washingsoda)**

Sodium carbonate is one of the
important inorganic compounds used in
industries. It is prepared by Solvay process.
In this process, ammonia is converted
into ammonium carbonate which then
converted to ammonium bicarbonate by
passing excess carbon dioxide in a sodium
chloride solution saturated with ammonia.
The ammonium bicarbonate thus formed
reacts with the sodium chloride to give
sodium bicarbonate and ammonium
chloride. As sodium bicarbonate has poor
solubility, it gets precipitated. The sodium
bicarbonate is isolated and is heated to
give sodium carbonate. The equations
involved in this process are,

1.2NH3+ H2O + CO2 → (NH4)2CO3

2.(NH4)2CO3 + H2O + CO2 → 2 NH4HCO3

3.NH4HCO3 + NaCl →NH4Cl + NaHCO3

4.2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3+ CO2+ H2O

The ammonia used in this process
can be recovered by treating the resultant
ammonium chloride solution with calcium
hydroxide. Calcium chloride is formed as
a by-product.

**Properties:**

Sodium carbonate, commonly
known as washing soda, crystallises as
decahydrate which is white in colour. It
is soluble in water and forms an alkaline
solution. Upon heating, it looses the water
of crystallisation to form monohydrate.
Above 373 K, the monohydrate becomes
completely anhydrous and changes to a
white powder called soda ash.

1. Na2CO3·10H2O → Na2CO3·H2O + 9H2O

2. Na2CO3·H2O → Na2CO3+ H2O

**Uses:**

i. Sodium carbonate known as washing
soda and is used mainly for laundering.

ii. It is also used in water treatment to
convert the hard water to soft water.

iii. It is used in the manufacturing of
glass, paper, paint etc...

**Sodium chloride NaCl (Cooking salt orTable salt):**

Sodium chloride is isolated by
evaporation from sea water which contains
2.7 to 2.9% by mass. Approximately 50
lakh tons of salt are produced annually in
India by solar evaporation. Crude sodium
chloride can be obtained by crystallisation
of brine solution which contains sodium
sulphate, calcium sulphate, calcium
chloride and magnesium chloride as
impurities. Pure sodium chloride can
be obtained from crude salt as follows.
Firstly removal of insoluble impurities
by filtration from the crude salt solution
with minimum amount of water. Sodium
chloride can be crystallised by passing
HCl gas into this solution. Calcium and
magnesium chloride, being more soluble
than sodium chloride, remain in solution.

Sodium chloride melts at 1081K. It
has a solubility of 36.0 g in 100 g of water
at 273 K. The solubility does not increase
appreciably with increase in temperature.

**Uses :**

(i) It is used as a common salt or table
salt for domestic purpose.

(ii) It is used for the preparation of many
inorganic compounds such as NaOH
and Na2CO3

**Sodium hydroxide:**

Sodium hydroxide is prepared
commercially by the electrolysis of brine
solution in Castner-Kellner cell using a
mercury cathode and a carbon anode.
Sodium metal is discharged at the cathode
and combines with mercury to form
sodium amalgam. Chlorine gas is evolved
at the anode. The sodium amalgam thus
obtained is treated with water to give
sodium hydroxide.

1. At cathode : Na+ + e– → Na(amalgam)

2. At anode : Cl– → 1⁄2 Cl2 ↑+ e–

3. 2Na(amalgam)+2H2O→2NaOH+2Hg+H2↑

Sodium hydroxide is a white,
translucent and deliquescent solid, that
dissolves in water to give a strong alkaline
solution. It melts at 591 K. The sodium
hydroxide solution at the surface reacts
with the CO2 in the atmosphere to form
Na2CO3.

**Uses:**

* Sodium hydroxide is used in the
purification of bauxite (ore of
Aluminium) and petroleum refining
* It is used in the textile industries for
mercerising cotton fabrics
* It is used in the manufacture of soap,
paper and artificial silks.

**Sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3 (Baking soda):**

Sodium hydrogen carbonate or
sodium bicarbonate is used in baking
cakes pastries etc. It is called so because
it decomposes on heating to generate
bubbles of carbon dioxide, leaving holes
in cakes or pastries and making them light
and fluffy. This compound is prepared by
saturating a solution of sodium carbonate
with carbon dioxide. The white crystalline
powder of sodium bicarbonate, being less
soluble, precipitated out.

**Uses:**

• Primarily used as an ingredient in
baking.

• Sodium hydrogen carbonate is a mild
antiseptic for skin infections.

• It is also used in fire extinguishers.

**5.4 Biological importance of sodium and potassium**

Monovalent sodium and potassium
ions are found in large proportions in
biological fluids. These ions perform
important biological functions such as
maintenance of ion balance and nerve
impulse conduction. A typical 70 kg man
contains about 90 g of sodium and 170 g
of potassium compared with only 5 g of
iron and 0.06 g of copper.

Sodium ions are found primarily
on the outside of cells, being located
in blood plasma and in the interstitial
fluid which surrounds the cells. These
ions participate in the transmission of
nerve signals, in regulating the flow of
water across cell membranes and in the
transport of sugars and amino acids into
cells. Sodium and potassium, although so
similar chemically, differ quantitatively in
their ability to penetrate cell membranes,
in their transport mechanisms and in
their efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus,
potassium ions are the most abundant
cations within cell fluids, where they
activate many enzymes, participate in
the oxidation of glucose to produce ATP
and, with sodium, are responsible for the
transmission of nerve signals.

Sodium–potassium pump play an
important role in transmitting nerve signals.

**5.5 Alkaline earth metals**

Group 2 in the modern periodic
table contains the elements beryllium,
magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium
and radium. These elements with the
exception of beryllium are commonly
known as the alkaline earth metals because
their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in
nature and these metal oxides are found in
the earth’s crust.

![Alkaline metals](/books/chemistry/part-1/alkali-and-alkaline-earth-metals/alkali-and-alkaline-earth-metals/c5.png)

**Table 5.7 Abundance of important alkaline earth metals and their sources**

**5.5.1 General characteristics of alkaline earth metals**

**Physical state**

Beryllium is rare and radium is
the rarest of all comprising only 10 % of
igneous rocks. Magnesium and calcium
are very common in the earth’s crust,
with calcium the fifth-most-abundant
element, and magnesium the eighth.
Magnesium and calcium are found in
many rocks and minerals: magnesium
in carnallite, magnesite, dolomite and
calcium in chalk, limestone, gypsum.
Most strontium is found in the minerals
celestite and strontianite. Barium is slightly
less common, much of it in the mineral
barite. Radium, being a decay product of
uranium, is found in all uranium-bearing
ores.


{{< box title ="do you know" >}}

Many alkaline and alkaline earth metals
are used in creating colours, such as
strontium and barium, are the colourful
stars of a fireworks show. Combined
with the element chlorine, barium
sends up a green spark, calcium gives
orange and lithium gives medium red.
Strontium carbonate gives a bright
red colour Nitrates of sodium gives
orange, potassium and rubidium gives
violet colour and caesium gives indigo
colour. The burning "excites" the
electrons, pushing them into higher
than normal energy level; they release
their extra energy as a colourful burst
of light

The blue fireworks are the
hardest to make, since the compound
copper chloride breaks down in a
hot flame. In recent years, fireworks
experts have used magnalium- a
mixture of the alkaline earth metal
magnesium and aluminium - to boost
all firework colours. Magnalium has
made the blues brighter, but pyro
technicians are still searching for a
blue as brilliant as the red, green and
yellow colours.

**Electronic configuration**

These elements have two electrons
in the valence shell of their atoms, preceded
by the noble gas configuration. Their
general electronic configuration is written
as [Noble gas]ns2 where ‘n’ represents the
valence shell.

**Table 5.8 Electronic configuration of alkaline earth metals**


**Atomic and ionic radii**

The atomic and ionic radii of
alkaline earth metals are smaller than
the corresponding members of the alkali
metals. This is due to the fact the Group 2
elements having a higher nuclear charge
that allows electrons to be attracted more
strongly towards the nucleus. On moving
down the group, the radii increases due
to gradual increase in the number of the
shells and the screening effect.

**Common oxidation state**

The group 2 elements have two
electrons in their valence shell and by
losing these electrons, they acquire the
stable noble gas configuration. So these
elements exhibit +2 oxidation state in
their compounds.

**Ionisation enthalpy**

Due to a fairly large size of the
atoms, alkaline earth metals have low
ionisation enthalpies when compared to
‘p’ block elements. Down the group the
ionisation enthalpy decreases as atomic
size increases. This is due to the addition
of new shells as well as increase in the
magnitude of the screening effect of inner
shell electrons. Members of group 2 have
higher ionization enthalpy values than
group 1 because of their smaller size, with
electrons being more attracted towards
the nucleus of the atoms. Correspondingly
they are less electropositive than alkali
metals.

energy - Alkaline earth metals.")

Although IE1

values of alkaline
earth metals are higher than that of alkali
metals, the *IE2*values of alkaline earth
metals are much smaller than those of
alkali metals. This occurs because in
alkali metals the second electron is to be
removed from a cation, which has already
acquired a noble gas configuration. In
the case of alkaline earth metals, the
second electron is to be removed from a
monovalent cation, which still has one
electron in the outermost shell. Thus, the
second electron can be removed more
easily in the case of group 2 elements than
in group 1 elements.

**Hydration Enthalpies**

Compounds of alkaline earth metals
are more extensively hydrated than those
of alkali metals, because the hydration
enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions
are larger than those of alkali metal ions.
Like alkali metal ions, the hydration
enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions
also decrease with increase in ionic size
down the group.

1. Be > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba

e.g., Magnesium chloride and calcium
chloride exist as their hydrated crystals
*MgCl2.6H2O and CaCl2. 6H2O* respectively.
whereas NaCl and KCl do not form such
hydrates.

**Electronegativity**

In alkaline earth metals the
electronegativity values decrease as we
go down the group as seen in the alkali
metals.

**Flame colour and the spectra:**

When the alkaline earth metal salts
moistened with concentrated hydrochloric
acid are heated on a platinum wire in a
flame, they show characteristic coloured
flame as shown below.
