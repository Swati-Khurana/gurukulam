#### 5.1 s-Block Elements:

       The elements belonging to the group 1 and 2 in the modern periodic table are called
s-block elements. The elements belonging to these two groups are commonly known as
alkali and alkaline earth metals respectively. In this unit, we study their properties, uses,
important compounds and biological importance.

#### 5.2 Alkali metals:

         The word “alkali” is derived from the word al-qalīy meaning the plant ashes,
referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burnt plant
ashes, called potash contain mainly potassium carbonate. Alkali metal group consists
of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium. They are
all metals, generally soft and highly reactive. They form oxides and hydroxides and these
compounds are basic in nature.

##### 5.2.1 General characteristics of alkali metals:

       Alkali metals are highly reactive and are found in nature only as compounds.
Rubidium and caesium are found associated in minute quantities with minerals of other
alkali metals. Francium is radioactive and does not occur appreciably in nature. Francium
is highly radioactive; its longest-lived isotope has a half-life of only 21 minutes.
   **Table 5.1 Abundance of important alkali metals and their sources**

##### Electronic configuration

The general valence shell electronic configuration of alkali metals is ns^2 ,where ‘n’
represents the period number.


**Table 5.2 Electronic configuration of alkali metals**
| Element 	| Symbol 	| Atomic No. 	| Electronic configuration 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Lithium 	| Li 	| 3 	| [He]2s1 	|
| Sodium 	| Na 	| 11 	| [Ne]3s1 	|
| Potassium 	| K 	| 19 	| [Ar]4s1 	|
| Rubidium 	| Rb 	| 37 	| [Kr]5s1 	|
| Caesium 	| Cs 	| 55 	| [Xe]6s1 	|
| Francium 	| Fr 	| 87 	| [Rn]7s1 	|

##### Common oxidation state
     All these elements are highly electropositive in nature. They readily lose their valence
electron to give monovalent cations (M+). Alkali metals have only one oxidation state which is +1.

##### Atomic and ionic radii
     Being the first element of each period, alkali metals have the largest atomic and
ionic radii in their respective periods. On moving down the group, there is an increase in
the number of shells and, therefore, atomic and ionic radii increase. The monovalent ions
(M+) are smaller than the respective parent atoms as expected.

##### Ionisation enthalpy
 Alkali metals have the lowest
ionisation enthalpy compared to other
elements present in the respective period.
As we go down the group, the ionisation
enthalpy decreases due to the increase
in atomic size. In addition, the number
of inner shells also increases, which in
turn increases the magnitude of screening
effect and consequently, the ionisation
enthalpy decreases down the group.

The second ionisation enthalpies of
alkali metals are very high. The removal
of an electron from the alkali metals
gives monovalent cations having stable
electronic configurations similar to the
noble gas. Therefore, it becomes very
difficult to remove the second electron
from the stable configurations already
attained.

##### Hydration enthalpy

**Electronegativity:**
 Alkali metals have comparatively
smaller value of electronegativity than the
other elements in the respective period.
When they react with other elements,
they usually produce ionic compounds.
For example, they react with halogens to
form ionic halides.

**Flame colour and the spectra:**
When the alkali metal salts
moistened with concentrated hydrochloric
acid are heated on a platinum wire in a
flame, they show characteristic coloured
flame as shown below.

Table 5.4 Flame colour and wavelength

| Element 	| Colour 	| Wavelength Wavelength  (nm)      	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Lithium 	| Crimson red 	| 670.8 	|
| Sodium 	| Yellow 	| 589.2 	|
| Potassium 	| Lilac (violet) 	| 766.5 	|
| Rubidium 	| Reddish violet 	| 780.0 	|
| Caesium 	| Blue 	| 455.5 	|

The heat in the flame excites the
valence electron to a higher energy level.
When it drops back to its actual energy
level, the excess energy is emitted as light,
whose wavelength is in the visible region
as shown in the above table.

**5.2.2 Distinctive behavior of lithium**

The distinctive behaviour of Li+ ion is due to its exceptionally small size, high polarising
power, high hydration energy and non availability of d-orbitals.
