**Chapter Outline**

1.1 Attributes of Living organisms

1.2 Viruses

1.3 Classification of Living world

1.4 Bacteria

1.5 Fungi

Earth was formed some 4.6 billion years ago.
It is the life supporting planet with land forms
like mountains, plateaus, glaciers, etc. Life on
earth exists within a complex structure called
biosphere. There exist many mysteries and
wonders in the living world some are not visible but the activity of
some capture the attentionof all. For example the response of sun­
flower to the sunlight, the twinkling
firefly in the dark forest, the rolling water droplets on the surface of lotus
leaf, the closure of the leaf of venus fly trap
on insect touch and a squid squeezing ink to
escape from its predator. From this it is clear
that the wonder planet earth harbours both
landforms and life forms. Have you thought
of DNA molecule? It is essential for the
regulation of life and is made up of carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus.
thus nonliving and living things exist together
to make our planet unique.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/0.1.eng.png )


 According to a survey made by
Mora et al., 2011 the number of estimated
species on earth is 8.7 million. The living
world includes microbes, plants, animals
and human beings which possess unique
and distinct characteristic feature.



**1.1 Attributes of living organisms**

The attributes of living organisms are given
below and is represented in Figure 1.1. 

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/1.1.eng.png )


**Growth**

Growth is an intrinsic property of all living
organisms through which they can increase
cells both in number and mass. Unicellular
and multicellular organisms grow by cell
division. In plants, growth is indefinite and
occurs throughout their life. In animals,
growth is definite and occurs for some
period. Growth in non-living objects is
extrinsic. Mountains, boulders and sand
mounds grow by simple aggregation of
material on the surface. Living cells grow
by the addition of new protoplasm within
the cells. Therefore, growth in living thing
is intrinsic. In unicellular organisms like
Bacteria and Amoeba growth occurs by cell
division and such cell division also leads
to the growth of their population. Hence,
growth and reproduction are mutually
inclusive events.

**Cellular structure**

All living organisms are made up of cells
which may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
Prokaryotes are
unicellular,
lack
membrane bound nuclei and organelles like
mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
bodies and so on (Example: Bacteria and
Blue green algae). In Eukaryotes a definite
nucleus and membrane bound organelles
are present. Eukaryotes may be unicellular
(Amoeba) or multicellular (Oedogonium). 

**Reproduction**

Reproduction is one of the fundamental
characteristic features of living organisms.
It is the tendency of a living organism to
perpetuate its own species. There are two
types of reproduction namely asexual and
sexual (Figure 1.2). Asexual reproduction refers to the
production of the progeny possessing
features more or less similar to those of
parents. The sexual reproduction brings out
variation through recombination. Asexual
reproduction in living organisms occurs
by the production of conidia (Aspergillus,
Penicillium), budding (Hydra and Yeast),
binary fission (Bacteria and Amoeba)
fragmentation (Spirogyra), protonema
(Mosses) and regeneration (Planaria).
Exceptions are the sterile worker bees
and mules.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/2.2.eng.png )


**Response to stimuli**

All organisms are capable of sensing their
environment and respond to various physical,
chemical and biological stimuli. Animals senseheir surroundings by sense organs. This is
called Consciousness. Plants also respond to
the stimuli. Bending of plants towards sunlight,
the closure of leaves in touch-me-not plant
to touch are some examples for response to
stimuli in plants. This type of response is called
Irritability.


**Homeostasis**

Property of self-regulation and tendency to
maintain a steady state within an external
environment which is liable to change
is called Homeostasis. It is essential for
the living organism to maintain internal
condition to survive in the environment.

**Metabolism**

The sum of all the chemical reactions taking
place in a cell of living organism is called
metabolism. It is broadly divided into
anabolism and catabolism. The difference
between anabolism and catabolism is given
in Table 1.1.
**Table 1.1: Difference between
anabolism and catabolism**

| Anabolism |  Catabolism |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Building up process  | Breaking down process |   |   |   |
| Smaller molecules
combine together
to form larger molecule | Larger molecule break into smaller units |   |   |   |

Movement, Nutrition, Respiration and
Excretion are also considered as the property
of living things. The levels of organization
in living organism begin with atoms and
end in Biosphere. Each level cannot exist
in isolation instead they form levels of
integration as given in Figure 1.3.

**Activity 1.1**

Collect Vallisneria leaves or Chara from nearby
aquarium and observe a leaf or Chara thallus
(internodal region)under the microscope. You
could see cells clearly under the microscope.
Could you notice the movement of cytoplasm?
The movement of cytoplasm is called
cytoplasmic streaming or cyclosis.

**1.2 Viruses**

Did you go through the
headlines of newspapers
in recent times? Have
you heard of the terms
EBOLA, ZIKA, AIDS,
SARS, H1N1 etc.? There
are serious entities which are considered as
“Biological Puzzle” and cause disease in man.
They are called viruses. We have learnt about
the attributes of living world in the previous
chapter. Now we shall discuss about viruses
which connect the living and nonliving world. 

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/4.4.eng.png )


The word virus is derived from
Latin meaning ‘Poison’. Viruses are sub-
microscopic, obligate intracellular parasites.
They have nucleic acid core surrounded by
protein coat. Viruses in their native state
contain only a single type of nucleic acid
which may be either DNA or RNA. The
study of viruses is called Virology.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/5.5.eng.png ) 



**1.2.1 Milestones in Virology**

1796 Edward Jenner used vaccination for
small pox

1886 Adolf Mayer demonstrated the
infectious nature of Tobacco mosaic
virus using sap of mosaic leaves.

1892 Dimitry Ivanowsky proved that
viruses are smaller than bacteria.

1898 M.W. Beijierink defined the
infectious agent in tobacco leaves as
῾Contagium vivum fluidum’

1915 F.W.Twort identified Viral infection
in Bacteria.

1917 d’Herelle coined
the
term
‘Bacteriophage’.

1984 Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo
discovered HIV (Human Immuno
Deficiency Virus).

**1.2.2 Size and Shape**

Viruses are ultramicroscopic particles. They
are smaller than bacteria and their diameter
range from 20 to 300 nm. (1nm = 10 -9 metres).
Bacteriophage measures about 10-100 nm
in size. The size of TMV is 300×20 nm.

Generally viruses are of three types
based on shape and symmetry (Figure 1.4).

i. Cuboid symmetry – Example:
Adenovirus, Herpes virus.
ii. Helical symmetry – Example: Influenza
virus, TMV.
iii. Complex or Atypical – Example:
Bacteriophage, Vaccinia virus.

**1.2.3 Characteristic Features of Viruses**

**Living Characters**

• Presence of nucleic acid and protein.
• Capable of mutation
• Ability to multiply within living cells.
• Able to infect and cause diseases in living
beings.
• Show irritability.
• Host –specific

**Non-living Characters**

 • Can be crystallized.
• Absence of metabolism.
• Inactive outside the host.
• Do not show functional autonomy.
• Energy producing enzyme system is absent.

 ![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/6.6.eng.png ) 



**1.2.4 Classification of Viruses**

Among various classifications proposed
for viruses the classification given by David
Baltimore in the year 1971 is given below. The
classification is based on mechanism of RNA
production, the nature of the genome (single
stranded –ss or double stranded - ds), RNA or
DNA, the use of reverse transcriptase (RT), ss
RNA may be (+) sense or (–) antisense. Viruses
are classified into seven classes (Table 1.2).

**Viral genome**

Each virus possesses only one type of nucleic
acid either DNA or RNA. The nucleic acid
may be in a linear or circular form. Generallynucleic acid is present as a
single unit but in wound
tumour virus and in
influenza virus it is found
in segments. The viruses
possessing DNA are called
‘Deoxyviruses’ whereas those possessing
RNA are called ‘Riboviruses’. Majority of
animal and bacterial viruses are DNA viruses
(HIV is the animal virus which possess
RNA). Plant viruses generally contain RNA
(Cauliflower Mosaic virus possess DNA). The
nucleic acids may be single stranded or double
stranded. On the basis of nature of nucleic
acid viruses are classified into four Categories.
They are Viruses with ssDNA (Parvo viruses),
dsDNA (Bacteriophages), ssRNA (TMV)and
dsRNA(Wound Tumour Virus).




![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/7.7.eng.png ) 


 
#### 1.2.5 Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
Tobacco mosaic virus was discovered in 1892
by Dimitry Ivanowsky from the Tobacco
plant. Viruses infect healthy plants through
vectors like aphids, locusts etc. The first
visible symptom of TMV is discoloration of
leaf colour along the veins and show typical
yellow and green mottling which is the
mosaic symptom. The downward curling
and distortion of young apical leaves occurs,
plant becomes stunted and yield is affected.

Structure
Electron microscopic studies have revealed
that TMV is a rod shaped (Figure 1.4b). helical virus measuring about 300x20nm
with a molecular weight of 39x10 6 Daltons.
The virion is made up of two constituents, a
protein coat called capsid and a core called
nucleic acid. The protein coat is made up
of approximately 2130 identical protein
subunits called capsomeres which are
present around a central single stranded
RNA molecule. The genetic information
necessary for the formation of a complete
TMV particle is contained in its RNA. The
RNA consists of 6,500 nucleotides.

#### 1.2.6 Bacteriophage
Viruses infecting bacteria are called
Bacteriophages. It literally means ‘eaters
of bacteria’ (Gr: Phagein = to eat). Phages
are abundant in soil, sewage water, fruits,
vegetables, and milk.

Structure of T 4 bacteriophage

The T 4 phage is tadpole shaped and consists
of head, collar, tail, base plate and fibres
(Figure 1.4). The head is hexagonal which
consists of about 2000 identical protein
subunits. The long helical tail consists of
an inner tubular core which is connected
to the head by a collar. There is a base plate
attached to the end of tail. The base plate
contains six spikes and tail fibres. These
fibres are used to attach the phage on the
cell wall of bacterial host during replication.
A dsDNA molecule of about 50 µm is tightly
packed inside the head. The DNA is about
1000 times longer than the phage itself.

### 1.2.7 Multiplication or Life Cycle ofPhages

Phages multiply through two different types
of life cycle. 

a. Lytic or Virulent cycle 

b.Lysogenic or Avirulent life cycle.

a. Lytic Cycle
During lytic cycle of phage, disintegration
of host bacterial cell occurs and the progeny
virions are released (Figure 1.5a). The steps
involved in the lytic cycle are as follows:
(i) Adsorption
Phage (T 4 ) particles interact with cell wall of
host (E. coli). The phage tail makes contact
between the two, and tail fibres recognize the
specific receptor sites present on bacterial cell
surface. The lipopolysaccharides of tail fibres
act as receptor in phages. The process involving
the recognition of phage to bacterium is called
landing. Once the contact is established
between tail fibres and bacterial cell, tail fibres
bend to anchor the pins and base plate to the
cell surface. This step is called pinning.

(ii) Penetration
The penetration process involves mechani-
cal and enzymatic digestion of the cell wall
of the host. At the recognition site phage
digests certain cell wall structure by viral
enzyme (lysozyme). After pinning the tail
sheath contracts (using ATP) and appears
shorter and thicker. After contraction of the
base plate enlarges through which DNA is
injected into the cell wall without using met-
abolic energy. The step involving i ­ njection of
DNA particle alone into the bacterial cell is
called Transfection. The empty protein coat
leaving outside the cell is known as ‘ghost’.
(iii) Synthesis
This step involves the degradation of
bacterial chromosome, protein synthesis
and DNA replication. The phage nucleic
acid takes over the host biosynthetic
machinery. Host DNA gets inactivated and
breaks down. Phage DNA suppresses the
synthesis of bacterial protein and directs
the metabolism of the cell to synthesis
the proteins of the phage particles and
simultaneously replication of Phage DNA
also takes place.
(iv) Assembly and Maturation
The DNA of the phage and protein coat are
synthesized separately and are assembled
to form phage particles. The process of
assembling the phage particles is known as
maturation. After 20 minutes of infection,
about 300 new phages are assembled.
(v) Release
The phage particle gets accumulated inside
the host cell and are released by the lysis of
host cell wall.


![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/8.8.eng.png )

b. Lysogenic Cycle
In the lysogenic cycle the phage DNA gets
integrated into host DNA and gets multiplied
along with nucleic acid of the host. No independent
viral particle is formed (Figure 1.5b).
As soon as the phage injects its linear
DNA into the host cell, it becomes circular
and integrates into the bacterial chromosome
by recombination. The integrated phage DNA
is now called prophage. The activity of the
prophage gene is repressed by two repressor
proteins which are synthesized by phage genes.
This checks the synthesis of new phages within
the host cell. However, each time the bacterial cell divides, the prophage multiplies along with
the bacterial chromosome. On exposure to UV
radiation and chemicals the excision of phage
DNA may occur and results in lytic cycle.

{{< box title="Do You Know?" type="objective" >}}
Viruses infecting blue green algae are called Cyanophages and are first reported by Safferman
and Morris in the year 1963(Example LPP1- Lyngbya, Plectonema and Phormidium).

Similarly, Hollings(1962) reported viruses infecting cultivated Mushrooms and causing
die back disease. The viruses attacking fungi are called **Mycoviruses** or **Mycophages**.
{{< /box >}}

**Virion** is an intact infective virus particle
which is non-replicating outside a host cell.

**Viroid** is a circular molecule of ssRNA
without a capsid and was discovered by
T.O.Diener in the year 1971. The RNA of viroid
has low molecular weight. Viroids cause citrus
exocortis and potato spindle tuber disease in
plants.

**Virusoids** were discovered by J.W.Randles
and Co-workers in 1981.They are the small
circular RNAs which are similar to viroids but
they are always linked with larger molecules of
the viral RNA.

**Prions** were discovered by Stanley
B. Prusiner in the year 1982 and are protein-
aceous infectious particles. They are the caus-
ative agents for about a dozen ­fatal ­degenerative
disorders of the central ­nervous system of
humans and other a ­ nimals. For example
Creutzfeldt – Jakob Disease (CJD), Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) – com-
monly known as mad cow disease and scrapie
disease of sheep.

### 1.2.8 Viral diseases

Viruses are known to cause disease in plants,animals and Human beings (Figure 1.6). A list of viral disease is given in Table 1.3.

## 1.3 Classification of Living World


From the previous chapter we know that the
planet earth is endowed with living and non
-living things. In our daily life we see several
things in and around us. Imagine, you are
on a trip to Hill station. You are enjoying the
beauty of mountains, dazzling colour of the
flowers, and melodious sound of the birds. You
may be capturing most of the things you come
across in the form of photography. Now, from
this experience can you mention the objects
you have come across? Can you record your
observations and tabulate them?. How will you
organize the things? Will you place mountain
and flowers together or tall trees and trailing
herbs in one category or place it in different
category? If you place it in different category,
what made you to place them in different
category? So classification is essential and could
be done only by understanding and comparing
the things based on some characters. In this
chapter we shall learn about classification of
living world.

Many attempts have made in the past to
classify the organisms on earth. **Theophrastus**,
“Father of Botany” used the morphological
characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs
and herbs. Aristotle classified animals into
two groups. i.e., *Enaima* (with red blood) and
*Anaima* (without red blood).

Carl Linnaeus classified living world into two groups namely Plants and Animals based on morphological characters. His classification faced major setback because Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes were grouped together. Similarly
fungi, heterotrophic organisms were placed
along with the photosynthetic plants. In course
of time, the development of tools compelled
taxonomists to look for different areas like
cytology, anatomy, embryology, molecular
biology, phylogeny etc., for classifying
organisms on earth. Thus, new dimensions to
classifications were put forth from time to time.

#### 1.3.1 Need of Classification
Classification is essential to achieve
following needs.
• To relate things based on common
characteristic features.
• To define organisms based on the salient
features.
• Helps in knowing the relationship
amongst different groups of organisms.
• It helps in understanding the evolutionary
relationship between organisms.

#### 1.3.2 Classification of Living World
A comparison of classification proposed
for classification of living world is given in
Table 1.4.

#### 1.3.3 Five Kingdom Classification
R.H.Whittaker, an American taxonomist
proposed five Kingdom classification in the
year 1969. The Kingdoms include Monera,Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.(Figure 1.7).

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Tab1.4.eng.png )

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Tab1.5.eng.png )

The criteria adopted for the classification include cell structure, thallus organization, mode of nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic relationship. A comparative account of the salient features of each Kingdom is given in Table 1.5.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.7.eng.png )

**Merits**

• The classification is based on the complexity
of cell structure and organization of thallus.

• It is based on the mode of nutrition

• Separation of fungi from plants

• It shows the phylogeny of the organisms

**Demerits**


• The Kingdom Monera and protista
accommodate both autotrophic and
heterotrophic organisms, cell wall lacking
and cell wall bearing organisms thus making
these two groups more heterogeneous.

• Viruses were not included in the system.

Carl Woese and co-workers in the year 1990 introduced three domains of life viz., Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya based on the difference in rRNA nucleotide sequence, lipid structure
of the cell membrane. A revised six Kingdom classification for living world was proposed 
by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in the year 1998 and the Kingdom Monera is divided in to
Archaebacteria and Eubacteria. Recently Ruggierio et al., 2015 published
a seven Kingdom classification which is a practical extension of
Thomas Cavalier’s six Kingdom scheme. According to this classification there are two
Super Kingdoms. (Prokaryota and Eukaryota) Prokaryota includes two Kingdoms
namely Archaebacteria and Eubacteria. Eukaryota includes the Protozoa, Chromista,
Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.A new Kingdom, the Chromista was erected and it included
all algae whose chloroplasts contain chlorophyll a and c, as well as various colourless forms
that are closely related to them.Diatoms, Brown algae, Cryptomonads and
Oomycetes were placed under this Kingdom.

breve and Gonyaulax tamarensis.A major red tide incident in west coast of Florida in
the year 1982 killed Hundreds and thousands of fishes.

#### 1.4 Bacteria
#### *Bacteria Friends or Foes?*

Have you noticed the preparation of curd in our home? A little drop of curd turns
the milk into curd after some time. What is responsible for this change? Why it Sours?
The change is brought by Lactobacillus lactis, a bacterium present in the curd. The
sourness is due to the formation of Lactic acid. Have you been a victim of Typhoid? It
is a bacterial disease caused by Salmonella
typhi, a bacterium. So we can consider this
prokaryotic organism as friend and foe, due
to their beneficial and harmful activities.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.7.x.eng.png )

#### 1.4.1 Milestones in Bacteriology
1829 C.G. Ehrenberg coined the term Bacterium

1884 Christian Gram introduced Gram staining method

1923 David H. Bergy published First editionof  Bergey’s Manual
1928 Fredrick Griffith discovered Bacterial
transformation

1952 Joshua Lederberg discovered of Plasmid
Bacteria are prokaryotic, unicellular, ubiq-
uitous, microscopic organisms. The study
of Bacteria is called Bacteriology. Bacteria
were first discovered by a Dutch scientist,
Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and were
called “animalcules”.
#### 1.4.2 General characteristic features of Bacteria
• They are Prokaryotic organisms and
lack nuclear membrane and membrane
bound organelles.

• The Genetic material is called nucleoid
or genophore or incipient nucleus

• The cell wall is made up of Polysaccharides
and proteins

• Most of them lack chlorophyll, hence
they are heterotrophic (Vibrio cholerae)
but some are autotrophic and possess
Bacteriochlorophyll (Chromatium)

• They reproduce vegetatively by Binary
fission and endospore formation.

• They exhibit variations which are due to
genetic recombination and is achieved
through conjugation, transformation
and transduction.
The shape and flagellation of the bacteria
varies and is given in Figure 1.8.


![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.8.eng.png )

**Capsule/Glycocalyx**

The bacterial cell reveals three
layers (i) Capsule/Glycocalyx (ii) Cell
wall and (iii) Cytoplasm (Figure 1.9).
Capsule/Glycocalyx
Some bacteria are surrounded by a
gelatinous substance which is composed of
polysaccharides or polypeptide or both. A
thick layer of glycocalyx bound tightly to the


![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.9.eng.png )



cell wall is called capsule. It protects cell from
desiccation and antibiotics. The sticky nature
helps them to attach to substrates like plant
root surfaces, Human teeth and tissues. It
helps to retain the nutrients in bacterial cell.

Helicobacter pylori,a Gram negative
bacterium • Bt toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis
finds application in raising insect
resistant crops (Bt Crops).
{{< /box >}}

**Cell wall**
The bacterial cell wall is granular and is rigid. It
provides protection and gives shape to the cell.
The chemical composition of cell wall is rather
complex and is made up of peptidoglycan
or mucopeptide (N-acetyl glucosamine,
N-acetyl muramic acid and peptide chain of
4 or 5 aminoacids). One of the most abundant
polypeptide called porin is present and it helps
in the diffusion of solutes.

**Plasma membrane**
The plasma membrane is made up of
lipoprotein. It controls the entry and exit
of small molecules and ions. The enzymes
involved in the oxidation of metabolites (i.e., the
respiratory chain) as well as the photosystems
used in photosynthesis are present in the
plasma membrane.

**Cytoplasm**
Cytoplasm is thick and semitransparent. It
contains ribosomes and other cell inclusions.
Cytoplasmic inclusions like glycogen, poly-β-
hydroxybutyrate granules, sulphur granules
and gas vesicles are present.

**Bacterial chromosome**
The bacterial chromosome is a single circular
DNA molecule, tightly coiled and is not
enclosed in a membrane as in Eukaryotes.
This genetic material is called **Nucleoid or
Genophore**. It is amazing to note that the DNA
of E.coli which measures about 1mm long when
uncoiled, contains all the genetic information of
the organism. The DNA is not bound to **histone**
proteins. The single chromosome or the DNA
molecule is circular and at one point it is attached
to the plasma membrane and it is believed that
this attachment may help in the separation of
two chromosomes after DNA replication.

**Plasmid**
Plasmids are extra chromosomal double
stranded, circular, self-replicating, autonomous
elements. The size of a plasmid varies from
1 to 500 kb usually plasmids contribute to
about 0.5 to 5.0% of the total DNA of bacteria.
They contain genes for ­
fertility, antibiotic
resistant and heavy metals. It also help in the
production of bacteriocins and toxins which
are not found in bacterial chromosome. The
number of plasmids per cell varies. Plasmids
are classified into different types based on
the function. Some of them are F (Fertility)
factor, R ­(Resistance) plasmids, Col (Colicin)
plasmids, Ri (Root i ­ nducing) plasmids and Ti
(Tumour inducing) plasmids.

**Mesosomes**
These are localized infoldings of plasma
membrane produced into the cell in the form
of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They are
clumped and folded together to maximize
their surface area and helps in respiration and
in binary fission.

**Polysomes / Polyribosomes**
The ribosomes are the site of protein
synthesis. The number of ribosome
per cell varies from 10,000 to 15,000.
The ribosomes are 70S type and consists of two
subunits (50S and 30S). The ribosomes are held
together by mRNA and form polyribosomes
or polysomes.

**Flagella**
Certain motile bacteria have numerous thin
hair like projections of variable length emerge
from the cell wall called flagella. It is 20–30 μm
in diameter and 15 μm in length. The flagella
of Eukaryotic cells contain 9+2 microtubles
but each flagellum in bacteria is made up of a
single fibril. Flagella are used for locomotion.
Based on the number and position of flagella
there are different types of bacteria (Figure 1.8)

**Fimbriae or Pili**
Pili or fimbriae are hair like appendages found
on surface of cell wall of gram-negative bacteria
(Example: Enterobacterium). The pili are 0.2 to
20 µm long with a diameter of about 0.025µm.
In addition to normal pili there are special type
of pili which help in conjugation called sex pili
are also found.

#### 1.4.4 Gram staining procedure

The Gram staining method to differentiate
bacteria was developed by Danish Physician
Christian Gram in the year1884. It is a
differential staining procedure and it classifies
bacteria into two classes - Gram positive and
Gram negative. The steps involved in Gram
staining procedure is given in Figure 1.10. The
Gram positive bacteria retain crystal violet and
appear dark violet whereas Gram negative type
loose the crystal violet and when counterstained
by safranin appear red under a microscope.
Most of the gram positive cell wall contain
considerable amount of teichoic acid and
teichuronic acid. In addition, they may contain
polysaccharide molecules. The gram negative
cell wall contains three components that lie
outside the peptidoglycan layer. 1. Lipoprotein
2. Outer membrane 3.Lipopolysaccharide.
Thus the different results in the gram stain are due to differences in the structure and
composition of the cell wall. The difference
between Gram Positive and Gram negative
bacteria is given in Table 1.6.

### 1.4.5 Life processes in Bacteria Respiration

Two types of respiration are found in
Bacteria. They are 1. Aerobic respiration
2. Anaerobic respiration.

**1. Aerobic respiration**
These bacteria require oxygen as terminal
acceptor and will not grow under anaerobic
conditions. (i.e. in the absence of O 2 )
**Example**: Streptococcus.

**Obligate aerobes**
Some Micrococcus **species** are obligate
aerobes (i.e. they must have oxygen to survive)

**2. Anaerobic respiration**
These bacteria do not use oxygen for growth
and metabolism but obtain their energy from
fermentation reactions.**Example**: *Clostridium*

**Facultative anaerobes**
There are bacteria that can grow e ­ ither
using oxygen as a terminal electron a ­ cceptor
or anaerobically using fermentation reaction
to obtain energy. When a facultative anaerobe
such as E. coli is present at a site of infection like
an abdominal ­abscess, it can rapidly consume all
available O 2 and change to anaerobic metabolism
producing an anaerobic environment and thus
allow the anaerobic bacteria that are present to
grow and cause disease. **Example**: Escherichia
coli and ­Salmonella.

**Capnophilic Bacteria**
Bacteria which require CO 2 for their growth
are called as capnophilic bacteria. **Example**:
Campylobacter.

#### Nutrition
On the basis of their mode of nutrition
bacteria are classified into two types namely
autotrophs and heterotrophs.

**I Autotrophic Bacteria**
Bacteria which can synthesise their own food
are called autotrophic bacteria. They may be
further subdivided as

**A. Photoautotrophic bacteria**
Bacteria use sunlight as their source of energy
to synthesize food. They may be

**1. Photolithotrophs**
In photolithotrophs the hydrogen donor is an
inorganic substance.

**a. Green sulphur bacteria**: In this type of
bacteria the hydrogen donor is H 2 S and
possess pigment called **Bacterioviridin**.
Example: Chlorobium.

**b. Purple sulphur bacteria**: For bacteria
belong to this group the hydrogen donor is
thiosulphate, **Bacteriochlorophyll** is present.
Chlorophyll containing chlorosomes are
present Example: *Chromatium*

**2. Photoorganotrophs**
They utilize organic acid or alcohol as
hydrogen donor. Example: Purple non
sulphur bacteria – *Rhodospirillum*.

**B. Chemoautotrophic bacteria**
They do not have photosynthetic pigment
hence they cannot use sunlight energy. This
type of bacteria obtain energy from organic
or inorganic substance.

**1. Chemolithotrophs**
This type of bacteria oxidize inorganic
compound to release energy.
Examples:
1. Sulphur bacteria - *Thiobacillus thiooxidans*
2. Iron bacteria - *Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans*
3. Hydrogen bacteria - *Hydrogenomonas*
4. Nitrifying bacteria - *Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter*

**2. Chemoorganotrophs**
This type of bacteria oxidize organic
compounds to release energy.
Examples:
1. Methane bacteria –*Methanococcus*
2. Acetic acid bacteria – *Acetobacter*
3. Lactic acid bacteria – *Lactobacillus*

**II. Heterotrophic Bacteria**
They are Parasites (*Mycobacterium*) Saprophytes
(*Bacillus mycoides*) or Symbiotic (*Rhizobium*) in root nodules of leguminous crops.

#### 1.4.6 Reproduction in Bacteria
Bacteria reproduces asexually by binary
fission, conidia and endospore formation
(Figure 1.11). Among these, binary fission
is the most common one.

**Binary fission**
Under favourable conditions the cell divides
into two daughter cells. The nuclear material
divides first and it is followed by the formation
of a simple median constriction which finally
results in the separation of two cells.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.11.eng.png )

**Endospores**
During unfavourable condition bacteria
produce endospores. Endospores are produced
in *Bacillus megaterium*, *Bacillus sphaericus*
and *Clostridium tetani*. Endospores are thick
walled resting spores. During favourable
condition, they germinate and form bacteria.

**Sexual Reproduction**
Typical sexual reproduction involving the
formation and fusion of gametes is absent in
bacteria. However gene recombination can
occur in bacteria by three different methods
they are
1. Conjugation
2. Transformation
3. Transduction

**1. Conjugation**
J. Lederberg and Edward L. Tatum
demonstrated conjugation in E. coli. in the
year 1946. In this method of gene transfer
the donor cell gets attached to the recipient
cell with the help of pili. The pilus grows
in size and forms the conjugation tube.
The plasmid of donor cell which has the F +
(fertility factor) undergoes replication. Only
one strand of DNA is transferred to the
recipient cell through conjugation tube. The
recipient completes the structure of double
stranded DNA by synthesizing the strand
that complements the strand acquired from
the donor (Figure 1.12).

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.12.eng.png )

**2. Transformation**

Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to
another is called transformation (Figure 1.13).
In 1928 the bacteriologist Frederick Griffith
demonstrated transformation in Mice using
Diplococcus pneumoniae. Two strains of this
bacterium are present. One strain produces
smooth colonies and are virulent in nature
(S-type). In addition another strain produce
rough colonies and are avirulent (R-type).
When S-type of cells were injected into the
mouse, the mouse died. When R-type of
cells were injected, the mouse survived. He
injected heat killed S-type cells into the mouse.
The mouse did not die. When the mixture of
heat killed S-type cells and R-type cells were
injected into the mouse, the mouse died. The
avirulent rough strain of Diplococcus had been
transformed into S-type cells. The hereditary
material of heat killed S-type cells had
transformed R-type cell into virulent smooth
strains. Thus the phenomenon of changing
the character of one strain by transferring the DNA of another strain into the former is called
Transformation.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.13.eng.png )

**3. Transduction**
Zinder and Lederberg (1952) discovered
Transduction in *Salmonella typhimurum*.
Phage mediated DNA transfer is called
Transduction (Figure 1.14).

**Transduction is of two types**
(i) Generalized transduction (ii) Special-
ized or Restricted transduction

**(i) Generalized Transduction**
The ability of a bacteriophage to carry
genetic material of any region of bacterial
DNA is called generalised transduction.

**(ii) Specialized or Restricted Transduction**
The ability of the bacteriophage to carry
only a specific region of the bacterial DNA is
called specialized or restricted transduction.

### 1.4.8 Archaebacteria
Archaebacteria are primitive prokaryotes and
are adapted to thrive in extreme environments
like hot springs, high salinity, low pH and so
on. They are mostly chemoautotrophs. The
unique feature of this group is the presence of
lipids like glycerol & isopropyl ethers in their
cell membrane. Due to the unique chemical
composition the cell membrane show resistance
against cell wall antibiotics and lytic agents.
Example: *Methanobacterium*, *Halobacterium*,
*Thermoplasma*.

#### 1.4.9 Cyanobacteria (Blue Green Algae)

**How old are Cyanobacteria ? Stromatolites reveals the truth**
Stromatolites are deposits
formed when colonies of
cyanobacteria bind with
calcium carbonate. They have
a geological age of 2.7 billion
years. Their abundance in
the fossil record indicates that cyanobacteria
helped in raising the level of free oxygen in
the atmosphere.!

**Cyanobacteria** are popularly called as
'Blue green algae' or 'Cyanophyceae'. They
are photosynthetic, prokaryotic organisms.
According to evolutionary record Cyanobacteria
are primitive forms and are found in different
habitats. Most of them are fresh water and few
are marine (*Trichodesmium and Dermacarpa*)
*Trichodesmium erythraeum* a cyanobacterium
imparts red colour to Red sea. Species of
*Nostoc, Anabaena* lead an endophytic life in the
coralloid root of *Cycas*, leaves of aquatic fern
*Azolla* by establishing a symbiotic association
and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Members like
*Gloeocapsa, Nostoc, Scytonema* are found as
phycobionts in lichen thalli.

**Salient features**
• The members of this group are prokaryotes
and lack motile reproductive structures.

• The thallus is unicellular in *Chroococcus*,
Colonial in *Gloeocapsa* and filamentous
trichome in *Nostoc*
.
• Gliding movement is noticed in some
species (*Oscillatoria*).

• The protoplasm is differentiated into
central region called centroplasm and
peripheral region bearing chromatophore
called chromoplasm.

• The photosynthetic pigments include
c-phyocyanin and c-phycoerythrin along
with myxoxanthin and myxoxanthophyll.

• The reserve food material is Cyanophycean
starch.

• In some forms a large colourless cell is found
in the terminal or intercalary position
called Heterocysts. They are involved in
nitrogen fixation.

• They reproduce only through vegetative
methods and produce Akinetes (thick wall
dormant cell formed from vegetative cell),
Hormogonia (a portion of filament get
detached and reproduce by cell division),
fission and endospores.

• The presence of mucilage around the
thallus is characteristic feature of this
group. Therefore, this group is also called
Myxophyceae.

• Sexual reproduction is absent.

• Microcystis aeruginosa,
Anabaena flos-aquae cause water blooms and release
toxins and affect the aquatic organism.
Most of them fix atmospheric nitrogen and
are used as biofertilizers (Example: *Nostoc*,
*Anabaena*). Spirulina is rich in protein
hence it is used as single cell protein.
The thallus organisation and methods of
reproduction is given in Figure 1.16.

### 1.4.10 Mycoplasma or Mollicutes

The Mycoplasma are very small (0.1–0.5µm),
pleomorphic gram negative microorganisms.
They are first isolated by Nocard and co-
workers in the year 1898 from pleural fluid of
cattle affected with bovine pleuropneumonia.
They lack cell wall and appear like “Fried Egg”
in culture. The DNA contains low Guanine
and Cytosine content than true bacteria. They
cause disease in animals and plants. Little leaf
of brinjal, witches broom of legumes phyllody
of cloves, sandal spike are some plant diseases
caused by mycoplasma. Pleuropneumonia is
caused by *Mycoplasma mycoides*. The structure
of Mycoplasma is given in Figure 1.17.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig.1.17.eng.png )

### 1.4.11 Actinomycetes (Actinobacteria)

Actinomycetes are also called ‘Ray fungi’ due to
their mycelia like growth. They are anaerobic
or facultative anaerobic microorganisms and
are Gram positive. They do not produce an
aerial mycelium. Their DNA contains high
guanine and cytosine content (Example:
­ *Streptomyces*).

*Frankia* is a symbiotic actinobacterium
which produces root nodules and fixes
nitrogen in non – leguminous plants such
as *Alnus* and *Casuarina*. They produce
multicellular sporangium. *Actinomyces bovis*
grows in oral cavities and cause lumpy jaw.

*Streptomyces* is a mycelial forming
Actinobacteria which lives in soil, they impart
“earthy odour” to soil after rain which is due
to the presence of Geosmin (volatile organic
compound). Some important antibiotics
namely, Streptomycin, Chloramphenicol, and
Tetracycline are produced from this genus.

### 1.5 Fungi

## World War II and Penicillin History speaks on fungi

**Sir Alexander** Fleming
Discovery of Penicillin
in the year 1928 is a
serendipity in the world
of medicine. The History
of World War II recorded
the use of Penicillin in the form of yellow
powder to save lives of soldiers. For this
discovery - The wonderful antibiotic he
shared Nobel Prize in Medicine in the year
1945 along with Ernest Boris chain and Sir
Howard Walter Florey.

### 1.5.1 Milestones in Mycology
1729 P.A.Micheli conducted spore culture experiments

1767 Fontana proved that Fungi could cause disease in plants

1873 C.H. Blackley proved fungi could
cause allergy in Human beings

1904 A.F.Blakeslee reported heterothallism in fungi

1952 Pontecorvo and Roper reported parasexual cycle

The word ‘fungus’ is derived from Latin
meaning ‘mushroom’. Fungi are ubiquitous,
eukaryotic, achlorophyllous heterotrophic
organisms. They exist in unicellular or
multicellular forms. The study of fungi is
called mycology. (Gr. mykes – mushroom:
logos – study). P.A. Micheli is considered
as founder of Mycology. Few renowned
mycologists include Arthur H.R. Buller, John
Webster, D.L.Hawksworth, G.C.Ainsworth,
B.B.Mundkur, K.C.Mehta, C.V. Subramanian
and T.S. Sadasivan.

E.J. Butler is the Father of Indian Mycology. He
established Imperial Agricultural
Research Institute at Pusa, Bihar.
It was later shifted to New Delhi and at
present known as IndianAgr icultural
Research E.J. Butler (1874-1943)
Insitute (IARI). He published a book, ‘Fungi and Disease
in Plants’ on Indian plant diseases in the
year 1918.

### 1.5.2 General characteristic features

• Majority of fungi are made up of thin,
filamentous branched structures called
hyphae. A number of hyphae get
interwoven to form mycelium.The cell wall
of fungi is made up of a polysaccharide
called **chitin** (polymer of N-acetyl
glucosamine) and fungal cellulose.

• The fungal mycelium is categorised
into two types based on the presence or
absence of septa (Figure 1.18). In lower
fungi the hypha is aseptate, multinucleate
and is known as coenocytic mycelium
(Example: *Albugo*). In higher fungi a
septum is present between the cells of
the hyphae. Example: *Fusarium*.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig.1.18.eng.png )

• The mycelium is organised into loosely
or compactly interwoven fungal tissues
called **plectenchyma**. It is further
divided into two types **prosenchyma** and
**pseudoparenchyma**. In the former type
the hyphae are arranged loosely but parallel
to one another. In the latter hyphae are
compactly arranged and loose their identity.

• In holocarpic forms the entire thallus is
converted into reproductive structure
whereas in Eucarpic some regions of the
thallus are involved in the reproduction
other regions remain vegetative. Fungi
reproduce both by asexual and sexual
methods. The asexual phase is called
**Anamorph** and the sexual phase is called
**Teleomorph**. Fungi having both phases are
called **Holomorph**.

General sexual reproduction in fungi includes
three steps 1. Fusion of two protoplasts
(plasmogamy) 2. Fusion of nuclei (karyogamy)
and 3. Production of haploid spores through
meiosis. Methods of reproduction in fungi is
given in Figure 1.19.

### 1.5.3 Methods of Reproduction in Fungi

**Asexual Reproduction**
1. Zoospores: They are flagellate structures
produced in zoosporangia (Example:
Chytrids).

2. Conidia: The spores produced on
condiophores (Example:*Aspergillus*,*Penicillium*).

3. Oidia/Thallospores/Arthrospores:
The hypha divided and developed in to spores
called oidia (Example: *Erysiphe*).

4. Fission: The vegetative cell divides
into 2 daughter cells. (Example:
*Schizosaccharomyces*-yeast).

5. Budding: A small outgrowth is developed on
parent cell, which gets detached and becomes
independent. (Example: *Saccharomyces*-
yeast)

6. Chlamydospore: Thick walled resting
spores are called chlamydospores (Example:*Fusarium*)

**Sexual Reproduction**

1.Planogametic copulation: Fusion of motile
gamete is called planogametic copulation.
a. Isogamy – Fusion of morphologically and
physiologicall similar gametes. (Example:
*Synchytrium*). b. Anisogamy – Fusion
of morphologically or physiologically
dissimilar gametes (Example: *Allomyces*).
c. Oogamy – Fusion of both morphologically
and physiologically dissimilar gametes.
(Example: *Monoblepharis*).

2. Gametangial contact: During sexual
reproduction a contact is established
between antheridium and Oogonium
(Example: *Albugo*).

3. Gametangial copulation: Fusion of
gametangia to form zygospore (Example:
*Mucor*, *Rhizopus*).

4. Spermatization: In this method a uninucleate
pycniospore/microconidium is transferred
to receptive hyphal cell (Example: *Puccinia*,
*Neurospora*)

5. Somatogamy: Fusion of two somaticells of
the hyphae (Example: *Agaricus*)

### 1.5.4 Classification of Fungi

Many mycologists have attempted to classify
fungi based on vegetative and reproductive
characters.Traditional classifications
categorise fungi into 4 classes – Phycomycetes,
Ascomycetes,Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Among these ‘Phycomycetes’
include fungal species of Oomycetes,
Chytridiomycetes and Zygomycetes which
are considered as lower fungi indicating algal
origin of fungi. Constantine J. Alexopoulos and
Charles W. Mims in the year 1979 proposed
the classification of fungi in the book entitled
‘Introductory Mycology’. They classified fungi
into three divisions namely Gymnomycota,
Mastigomycota and Amastigomycota. There
are 8 subdivisions, 11 classes, 1 form class and
3 form subclasses in the classification proposed
by them.

The salient features of some of the
classes – Oomycetes, Zygomycetes,
Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Form
class Deuteromycetes are discussed below.
