2.7 Angiosperms**

Traditionally organisms existing on the
earth were classified into plants and
animals based on nutrition, locomotion and
presence or absence of cell wall. Bacteria,
Fungi, Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,
Gymnosperms and Angiosperms were
included under plant group. Recently,with the aid of molecular characteristics.
Bacteria and Fungi were segregated
and placed under separate kingdoms.
Botany is one of the oldest science in the
world because its origin was from time
immemorial as early men explored and
identified plants for the needs of food,
clothing, medicine, shelter etc., Plants are
unique living entities as they are endowed
with the power to harvest the light energy
from the sun and to convert it to chemical
energy in the form of food through the
astounding reaction, **photosynthesis**. They
not only supply nutrients to all living things
on earth but sequester carbon-di-oxide
during photosynthesis, thus minimizing
the effect of one of the major green house
gases that increase the global temperature.
Plants are diverse in nature, ranging
from microscopic algae to macroscopic
highly developed angiosperms. There are
mysteries and wonders in the plant world
in terms of size, shape, habit, habitat,
reproduction etc., Although plants are all
made up of cells there exists high diversity
in form and structure (Table 2.1).

##### 2.1 Classification of Plants

Classification widely accepted for plants
now include Embryophyta which is divided
into Bryophyta and Tracheophyta. The
latter is further ­divided into Pteridophyta
and Spermatophyta (Gymnospermae and
Angiospermae). An outline Classification of
Plant Kingdom is given in Figure 2.1

##### 2.2 Life Cycle Patterns in Plants

**Alternation of Generation**

Alternation of generation is common
in all plants. Alternation of the haploid
