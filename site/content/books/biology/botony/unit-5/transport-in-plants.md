Over 450 million years ago (the
Ordovician period in Paleozoic era) plants
migrated from their own sophisticated
water world to newly formed land. The land
had harsh environment; water availability
was deeper and so plants struggled for
getting water for their very existence. Some
of them failed to survive and rest adopted
themselves to the new world. The biggest
adaptations followed for their survival was
building their own water absorbing systems
to draw water from deep inside the land. The
creation and updating of water absorbing
system (vascular tissues) led to the diversity
of the plant kingdom. The gregarious growth
of prehistoric pteridophytes, gymnosperms
and present-day flowering plants led to the
biggest challenge in the transport of water
from root to several meters high trees
against gravity. In this chapter, we will study
the events taking place between the gain
of water in roots and loss in leaves and the
mechanisms behind the basic physical and
biological processes in the movement of
water, gases and minerals in plants. Further,
we study how food material synthesized
in the leaf can be transported to various
utilizing and storage areas against struggles
and challenges.

#### 11.1 Types of Transport

Transport is the process of moving water,
minerals and food to all parts of the plant
body. Conducting tissues such as xylem and
phloem play an important role in this.
What is the need for transport? Water
absorbed from roots must travel up to
leaves by xylem for food preparation by
photosynthesis. Likewise, food prepared
from leaves has to travel to all parts of the
plant including roots. Both the processes are
interconnected and depend on each other.
 Based on the distance travelled by water
(sap) or food (solute) they are classified as
(a) Short distance (Cell to cell transport)
and (b) Long distance transport.

{{<box title="The Plumbing system of Plants and Humans">}}

![Plumbing system of plants](/books/biology/unit-5/01.png) <br>

![Plumbing system of Human](books/biology/unit-5/02.png)

Plants and animals
evolved separately but   developed
c o m p a r a b l e
structures to control
transport of water
and dissolved
chemicals. But whose
transport system is
optimally designed
to offer selective
advantage? In plants,
transport through xylem has allowed
growth in height and colonization of diverse
habitats and the system has to be extensive
as Photosynthesis requires water. Murray’s
law predicts the thickness of branches in
transport networks, such that the cost for
transport and maintenance of the transport
medium is minimized. This law is observed
in the vascular and respiratory systems of
animals, xylem in plants, and the respiratory
system of insects. Further research in this
area will improve our understanding of
natural world.

**i. Short-distance (Cell to cell transport):**
Involvement of few cells, mostly in the
lateral direction. They are the connecting
link to xylem and phloem from root hairs
or leaf tissues respectively. Examples:
Diffusion, Imbibition, and Osmosis.<br>

**ii. Long-distance transport: Transport**
within the network of xylem or
phloem is an example for long-distance
transport.
**Examples:** Ascent of Sap and
Translocation
of Solutes. <br>

 Based on energy expenditure during
transport, they are classified as **(a) passive transport and**
**(b) active transport.** <br>

**i. Passive transport:** It is a downhill process
which utilizes physical forces
like gravity
and concentration. No energy
expenditure
is required. It includes
diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, imbibition, and osmosis.

**ii. Active transport:** It is a biological
process
and it runs based on the energy
obtained
from respiration. It is an uphill process.

#### 11.2 Cell to Cell Transport

Cell to cell or short distance transport covers
the limited area and consists of few cells. They
are the facilitators or tributaries to the longdistance
transport. The driving force for the
cell to cell transport can be passive or active
**(Figure 11.1)**. The following chart illustrate
the various types of cell to cell transport:

![cell to cell transport](/books/biology/unit-5/03.png)

##### 11.2.1 Passive Transport

1. **Diffusion**
When we expose a lightened incense stick
or mosquito coil or open a perfume bottle
in a closed room, we can smell the odour
everywhere in the room. This is due to the even
distribution of perfume molecules throughout
the room. This process is called **diffusion**.
In **diffusion**, the movement of molecules
is continuous and random in order in all
directions **(Figure 11.2)**.

![Distributionofmoleculesindiffusion,Initialstage](/books/biology/unit-5/04.png)

{{<box title="Diffusion:">}}
The net movement of molecules
from a region of their higher concentration
to a region of their lower concentration
along a concentration gradient until an
equilibrium is attained.
{{</box>}}

#### Characteristics of diffusion

i. It is a passive process, hence no energy
expenditure involved.<br>
ii. It is independent of the living system.<br>
iii. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids.<br>
iv. Diffusion is rapid over a shorter
distance but extremely slow over a
longer distance.<br>
v. The rate of diffusion is determined by
temperature, concentration gradient and
relative density.<br>

#### Significance of diffusion in Plants

i. Gaseous exchange of O2 and CO2
between the atmosphere and stomata
of leaves takes place by the process
of diffusion. O2 is absorbed during
respiration and CO2 is absorbed during
photosynthesis.<br>
ii. In transpiration, water vapour from
intercellular spaces diffuses into
atmosphere through stomata by the
process of diffusion.<br>
iii. The transport of ions in mineral salts
during passive absorption also takes place
by this process.<br>

{{<box title="Do you know">}}

Surgical theatres must be
free from germs to prevent
infection during surgeries. A mixture of
Formalin and Potassium permanganate
produces enormous fumes which will kill all
pathogens in an enclosed area. This method
is known as fumigation and operates by
diffusion.
{{</box>}}

**2. Facilitated Diffusion**
Cell membranes allow water and nonpolar
molecules to permeate by simple diffusion.
For transporting polar molecules such as
ions, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides and
many cell metabolites is not merely based on
concentration gradient. It depends on,
**i. Size of molecule:** Smaller molecules
diffuse faster.<br>
**ii. Solubility of the molecule:** Lipid soluble
substances easily and rapidly pass
through the membrane. But water soluble
substances are difficult to pass through
the membrane. They must be facilitated
to pass the membrane.

{{<box title="Types of Membrane Permeability">}}

A solution is made up of solute particles
dissolved in a solvent and the permeability
of the above components depends on the
nature of cell membranes, which is given
below:
**Impermeable:** Inhibit the movement
of both solvent and solute molecules.
Example: Suberised, cutinised or liginifid
cell walls.
**Permeable:** They allow diffusion of
both solvent and solute molecules through
them.**Example:** Cellulosic cell wall.
**Semi permeable:** Semi permeable
allow diffusion of solvent molecules
but do not allow the passage of solute
molecule. **Example:** Parchment paper.
**Selectively permeable:** All bio
membranes allow some solutes to pass
in addition to the solvent molecules.
**Example:** Plasmalemma, tonoplast, and
membranes of cell organelles.
{{</box>}}<br>
In facilitated diffusion, molecules cross
the cell membrane with the help of special
membrane proteins called transport proteins,
without the expenditure of ATP.
There are two types of transport proteins
present in the cell membrane. They are
channel protein and a carrier protein.

##### I. Channel Protein

Channel protein forms a channel or tunnel
in the cell membrane for the easy passage of
molecules to enter the cell. The channels are
either open or remain closed. They may open
up for specific molecules. Some channel
proteins create larger pores in the outer
membrane. **Examples:** Porin and Aquaporin.<br>
**i. Porin**
Porin is a large transporter protein found in
the outer membrane of plastids, mitochondria
and bacteria which facilitates smaller
molecules to pass through the membrane.<br>
**ii. Aquaporin**
Aquaporin is a water channel protein embedded
in the plasma membrane. It regulates the
massive amount of water transport across
the membrane (Figure 11.3). Plants contain
a variety of aquaporins. Over 30 types of
aquaporins are known from maize. Currently,

they are also recognized to transport substrates
like glycerol, urea, CO2, NH3, metalloids, and
**Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)** in addition
to water. They increase the permeability of the
membrane to water. They confer drought and
salt stress tolerance.<br>
![Aquaporin](/books/biology/unit-5/05.png)

##### II. Carrier Protein

Carrier protein acts as a vehicle to carry
molecules from outside of the membrane to
inside the cell and vice versa (Figure 11.4). Due
to association with molecules to be transported,
the structure of carrier protein gets modified
until the dissociation of the molecules.

![CarrierProtien](/books/biology/unit-5/06.png)

There are 3 types of carrier proteins classified
on the basis of handling of molecules and
direction of transport (Figure 11.5). They are,
i) **Uniport** ii) **Symport** iii) **Antiport.**
![Directionoftransport](/books/biology/unit-5/07.png)

**i. <em>Uniport</em>:** In this molecule of a single type
move across a membrane independent of
other molecules in one direction.<br>
**ii. <em>Symport or co-transport</em>:** The term
symport is used to denote an integral
membrane protein that simultaneously
transports two types of molecules across
the membrane in the same direction.<br>
**iii. <em>Antiport or Counter Transport</em>:** An
antiport is an integral membrane
transport protein that simultaneously
transports two different molecules,
in opposite directions, across the
membrane.

#### 11.2.2 Active Transport

The main disadvantage of passive transport
processes like diffusion is the lack of control
over the transport of selective molecules. There
is a possibility of harmful substances entering
the cell by a concentration gradient in the
diffusion process. But selective permeability of
cell membrane has a great control over entry and
exit of molecules. Active transport is the entry
of molecules against a concentration gradient
and an uphill process and it needs energy which
comes from ATP. Passive transport uses kinetic
energy of molecules moving down a gradient
whereas, active transport uses cellular energy
to move them against a gradient. The transport
proteins discussed in facilitated diffusion can
also transport ions or molecules against a
concentration gradient with the expenditure of
cellular energy as an active process. Pumps use
a source of free energy such as ATP or light to
drive the thermodynamically uphill transport
of ions or molecules. The pump action is
an example of active transport. Example:
Na + -K + -ATPase pump (Table 11.1).

#### 11.3 Plant Water Relations

Water plays an essential role in the life of the
plant. The availability of water influences the
external and internal structures of plants as
protoplasm is made of 60-80% water. Water is a
**universal solvent** since most of the substances
get dissolved in it and the high tensile strength
of water molecule is helpful in the ascent of sap.
Water maintains the internal temperature of
the plant as well as the turgidity of the cell.

#### 1.3.1 Imbibition

Colloidal systems such as **gum, starch,**
**proteins, cellulose, agar, gelatin** when placed
in water, will absorb a large volume of water and
swell up. These substances are called **imbibants**
and the phenomenon is i**imbibition.**
**Examples:** 1. The swelling of dry seeds
2.The swelling of wooden windows, tables, doors
due to high humidity during the rainy season.

{{<box title="">}}
**The Power of Imbibition**
In olden days, small wooden
pegs were inserted into
crevices of rocks followed by
continuous hydration. Due to imbibition
the volume of wooden peg increases and
cuts off rocks precisely.

**///create Box**
{{</box>}}

**Significance of imbibition**

i. During germination of seeds, imbibition
increases the volume of seed enormously
and leads to bursting of the seed coat.
ii. It helps in the absorption of water by roots
at the initial level.

or Babool tree or Almond tree. Immerse in
100ml of water. After 24 hours observe the
changes and discuss the results with your
teacher.<br>

#### 11.3.2 Water Potential (Ψ)
The concept of water potential
was introduced in 1960 by
**Slatyer and Taylor**. Water
potential is potential energy
of water in a system compared
to pure water when both temperature and
pressure are kept the same. It is also a measure
of how freely water molecules can move in
a particular environment or system. Water
potential is denoted by the Greek symbol **Ψ**
(psi) and measured in **Pascal (Pa)**. At standard
temperature, the water potential of pure water is
**zero.** Addition of solute to pure water decreases
the kinetic energy thereby decreasing the water
potential. Comparatively a solution always
has low water potential than pure water. In a
group of cells with different water potential, a
water potential gradient is generated. Water
will move from higher water potential to lower
water potential.
Water potential **(Ψ)** can be determined by,
1. Solute concentration or Solute ­potential
**(Ψ S)**
2. Pressure potential **(Ψ P )**
By correlating two factors, water potential is
written as,

{{<box title="" >}}
         Ψ W = Ψ S + Ψ P
Water Potential = Solute potential +
Pressure potential

{{</box>}}


**1. Solute Potential (Ψ S )**
Solute potential, otherwise known as **osmotic**
**potential** denotes the effect of dissolved solute
on water potential. In pure water, the addition
of solute reduces its free energy and lowers the
water potential value from zero to negative.
Thus the value of solute potential is always
negative. In a solution at standard atmospheric
pressure, water potential is always equal to
solute potential (Ψ W = Ψ S ).
**2. Pressure Potential (Ψ P )**

Pressure potential is a mechanical force working
against the effect of solute potential. Increased
pressure potential will increase water potential
and water enters cell and cells become 
This **positive hydrostatic pressure** within
the cell is called **Turgor pressure.** Likewise,
withdrawal of water from the cell decreases the
water potential and the cell becomes **flaccid.**
**3. Matric Potential (Ψ M )**

Matric potential represents the attraction
between water and the **hydrating colloid
or gel-like organic molecules in the cell
wall** which is collectively termed as **matric
potential.** Matric potential is also known as
**imbibition pressure.** The matric potential
is maximum (most negative value) in a dry
material.**Example:** The swelling of soaked
seeds in water.
#### 11.3.3 Osmotic Pressure and Osmotic Pressure

When a solution and its solvent (pure water)
are separated by a semipermeable membrane,
a pressure is developed in the solution, due to
the presence of dissolved solutes. This is called
**osmotic pressure (OP)**. Osmotic pressure
is increased with the increase of dissolved
solutes in the solution. More concentrated
solution (low **Ψ** or Hypertonic) has high
osmotic pressure. Similarly, less concentrated
solution (high **Ψ** or Hypotonic) has low
osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure of
pure water is always **zero** and it increases
with the increase of solute concentration.
Thus **osmotic pressure** always has a positive
value and it is represented as π.
Osmotic potential is defined as the ratio
between the number of solute particles and
the number of solvent particles in a solution.
Osmotic potential and osmotic pressure are
numerically equal. Osmotic potential has a
negative value whereas on the other hand
osmotic pressure has a positive value.
#### 11.3.4 Turgor Pressure and Wall Pressure
­ 
When a plant cell is placed in pure water
(hypotonic solution) the diffusion of water into
the cell takes place by endosmosis. It creates a
positive hydrostatic pressure on the rigid cell
wall by the cell membrane. Henceforth the
pressure exerted by the cell membrane towards
the cell wall is **Turgor Pressure (TP).**
The cell wall reacts to this turgor pressure
with **equal and opposite force,** and the
counter-pressure exerted by the cell wall
towards cell membrane is **wall pressure (WP)**.
Turgor pressure and wall pressure make
the cell fully turgid.
**TP + WP = Turgid.**

{{<box title="">}}
 ##### Activity

sudden closing of leaves when we
touch the ‘touch me not’ plant.
{{</box>}}

#### 11.3.5 Diffusion Pressure Deficit (DPD) or Suction Pressure (SP)

Pure solvent (hypotonic) has higher diffusion
pressure. Addition of solute in pure solvent
lowers its diffusion pressure. The difference
between the diffusion pressure of the solution
and its solvent at a particular temperature and
atmospheric pressure is called as **Diffusion
Pressure Deficit (DPD)** termed by **Meyer
(1938)**. DPD is increased by the addition of
solute into a solvent system. Increased DPD
favours endosmosis or it sucks the water from
hypotonic solution; hence **Renner** (1935)
called it as **Suction pressure**. It is equal to
the difference of osmotic pressure and turgor
pressure of a cell. The following three situations
are seen in plants:
• **DPD in normal cell**: DPD = OP – TP.
• **DPD in fully turgid cell**: Osmotic pressure
is always equal to turgor pressure in a fully
turgid cell.
• **OP = TP or OP-TP =0**. Hence DPD of fully
turgid cell is zero.
• **DPD in flaccid cell**: If the cell is in flaccid
condition there is no turgor pressure or
TP=0. Hence DPD = OP.

#### 11.3.6 Osmosis

Osmosis (Latin: Osmos-impulse, urge) is a
**special type of diffusion**. It represents the
movement of **water or solvent molecules**
through a selectively permeable membrane
**from the place of its higher concentration
(high water potential) to the place of its lower
concentration (low water potential).**

Types of Solutions based on concentration
**i. Hypertonic** (Hyper = High; tonic = solute):
This is a strong solution (low solvent/ high
solute / low **Ψ**) which **attracts solvent**
from other solutions.

**ii. Hypotonic** (Hypo = low; tonic = s ­ olute):
This is a weak solution (high solvent /low
or zero solute / high **Ψ**) and it out to other solutions **(­Figure 11.7)**.

**iii. Isotonic** (Iso = identical; tonic = soute):
It refers to two solutions having same
concentration. In this condition the net
movement of water molecule will be zero.
The term hyper, hypo and isotonic are
**relative terms **which can be used only in
comparison with another solution.

 **Figure 11.6: Thistle Funnel Experiment**

 Mouth of a thistle funnel is tied with
goat bladder. It acts as a semipermeable
membrane. Pour concentrated sugar
solution in the thistle funnel and mark
the level of solution. Place this in a beaker
of water. After some time, water level in
the funnel rises up steadily. This is due to
the inward diffusion of water molecules
through the semipermeable membrane
(Figure 11.6).
Conversely, if water in the beaker is
replaced by a sugar solution and sugar
solution in the thistle funnel replaced by
water, what will be happen?

**4. Reverse Osmosis**
Reverse Osmosis follows the same principles
of osmosis, but in the reverse direction. In
this process movement of water is reversed by
applying pressure to force the water against a
concentration gradient of the solution. In regular
osmosis, the water molecules move from the
higher concentration (pure water = hypotonic)
to lower concentration (salt water = hypertonic).
But in reverse osmosis, the water molecules
move from the lower concentration (salt water =
hypertonic) to higher concentration (pure water
= hypotonic) through a selectively permeable
membrane (Figure 11.9).
