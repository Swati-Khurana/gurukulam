As a traveller you would have got a chance
to observe the plants. It is an interesting fact
that all plants are not alike. Just spend some
time to observe the nature. You can notice

   **A Solution to pollution**

A new solution has come up for high
nutrient pollution and eutrophication
in surface waters. Floating Treatment
Wetlands (FTWs) offer promising
solution and it is a built structure
which measures around 3,000 sq.ft
and comprises four layers: floatable
bamboo at base, styrofoam second layer,
a third layer of gunny bags with gravels
and final layer to support cleaning
agents (plants). Native plants including
Vetivers, Citronella, Tulsi and Withania
are being researched for use as cleaning
agents. FTW works on the principle of
Hydroponics which is explained in this
chapter. Microbes grown on the roots of
these plants break down and consume
organic matter in water and reduce
pollution.

plants with attractive leaves, flowers and
fruits.
Can you say all plants are healthy and
uniform in growth? Some plants are not
healthy and show symptoms like texture
changes, stunted growth, chlorosis, necrosis
and so on. Can you tell what is the reason
