The Banyan tree continues to grow for
thousands of years and some others particularly
annual plants cease growth within a season or
within a year. Can you understand the reasons?
How does a zygote give rise to an embryo and
an embryo to a seedling? How does a new plant
structure arise from the pre-existing structure?
Growth is defined as an irreversible permanent
increase in size, shape, number,volume and dry
weight. Plant growth occurs by cell division, cell
enlargement, differentiation and maturation.<br>

Growth is measurable, it
is amazing to know that
one single maize root apical
meristem can give rise to
more than 17,500 new cells per hour and
cells in a watermelon may increase in size
upto 3,50,000 times.

Bamboos are evergreen
grasses and certain species
of it can grow at the rate of
growth 91 cm per day. The
Saguaro Cactus is a tree like
cactus and is a slow growing
plant. The rate of growth is one inch in the
first ten years and it does not begin to flower
until it is about 60 years old. It’s lifespan
exceeds 150 years and takes 75–100 years to
grow a side arm.<br>

#### 15.1 Characteristics of Growth <br>
• Growth increases in protoplasm at cellular
level.<br>
• Stem and roots are indeterminate in
growth due to continuous cell division
and is called **open form of growth.**<br>
• The primary growth of the plant is due
to the activity of apical meristem where,
new cells are added to root and shoot apex
causing linear growth of plant body.<br>
• The secondary vascular cambium and
cork cambium add new cells to cause
increase in girth.<br>
• Leaves, flowers and fruits are limited in
growth or determinate or **closed form growth.**<br>
• Monocarpic annual plants produce
flowers only once during lifetime and
dies. Example: Paddy and Bean <br>
• Monocarpic perennials produce flowers
only once during life time but the plants
survive for many years. Example: Bamboo.<br>
• Polycarpic perennials produce flowers every
year during life time. Example: Coconut.<br>
#### 15.1.1 Kinetics of growth<br>
It is an analysis of the motion of cells or
expansion.<br>
**1.Stages in Growth rate**<br>
The total period from initial to the final stage of
growth is called the **grand period of growth.**
The total growth is plotted against time and ‘S’
shaped sigmoid curve (Grand period curve) is
obtained. It consists of four phases.
They are:<br>
i. Lag phase<br>
ii. Log phase<br>
iii. Decelerating phase<br>
iv. Maturation phase<br>
**i. Lag phase**<br>
In this phase new cells are formed from
pre-existing cells slowly. It is found in the tip
of the stem, root and branches. It is the initial
stage of growth. In other words, growth starts
from this period.<br>
**ii. Log phase or exponential growth**<br>
Here, the newly formed cell increases in size
rapidly by deposition of cell wall material.
Growth rate is maximum and reaches top
because of cell division and physiological
processes are quite fast. The volume of
protoplasm also increases. It results in rapid
growth and causes elongation of internode in
the stem.<br>
**iii. Decelerating phase or Decline phase or slow growth phase**<br>
The rate of growth decreases and becomes
limited owing to internal and external or both
the factors because the metabolic process
becomes slow.<br>
**iv. Steady state period or maturation phase**<br>
In this phase cell wall thickening due to new
particle deposition on the inner surface of
the cell wall takes place. The overall growth
ceases and becomes constant. The growth rate
becomes zero.<br>
**2. Types of growth rate**<br>
The increased growth per unit time is termed as
growth rate. An organism or part of an organism
can produce more cells through arithmetic
growth or geometric growth or both.<br>
**i. Arithmetic Growth Rate**
If the length of a plant organ is plotted
against time, it shows a linear curve and this
growth is called arithmetic growth.<br>
• The rate of growth is constant and it
increases in an arithmetic manner.<br>
• Only one cell is allowed to divide
between the two-resulting progeny cell.<br>
• One continues to divide but the other
undergoes cell cycle arrest and begins
to develop, differentiate and mature.<br>
• After each round of cell division, only
a single cell remains capable of division
and one new body cell forms.<br>
For example, starting with a single cell after
round 1 of cell division there is one dividing
cell and one body cell. After round 2 there
are two body cells, after round 3 there are
three and so on (Figure 15.1).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/03.png)<br>
**Figure 15.1:** Arithmetic Growth Rate <br>
The plants single dividing cell would
undergo one million rounds of nuclear and
cellular division. If each round requires one
day, this type of arithmetic increase would
require one million days or 2739.7 years.
This arithmetic rate is capable of producing
small number of cells present in very small
parts of plants. For example the hair on
many leaves and stems consists of just a
single row of cells produced by the division
of the basal cell, the cell at the bottom of the
hair next to other epidermal cells. Hair may
contain 5 to 10 cells by the division of the
basal cell. So, all its cells could be produced
in just five to ten days. In the figure 15.2, on
plotting the hight of the plant against time a
linear curve is obtained. Mathematically it is
expressed as:<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/04.png)<br>
**Figure 15.2:** Constant Linear Growth <br>
L t = L o + rt <br>
L t = length at time ‘t’ <br>
L o = length at time zero <br>
r = growth rate of elongation per unit <br>
**ii. Geometric growth rate:**<br>
This growth occurs in many higher plants
and plant organs and is measured in size
or weight. In plant growth, geometric cell
division results if all cells of an organism or
tissue are active mitotically. Example: Round
three in the given figure 15.3, produces 8
cells as \\(2^3\\) = 8 and after round 20 there are \\(2^20\\)
= 1,048,576 cells.
The large plant or animal parts are
produced this way. In fact, it is common in
animals but rare in plants except when they
are young and small. Exponential growth
curve can be expressed as,<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/05.png)<br>
**Figure 15.3:** Geometric growth<br>
${W_1 = W_0e^{rt}}$ <br>
\\(W_1\\) =Final size (weight, height and
number)<br>
\\(W_0\\) =Initial size at the beginning of the
period <br>
r = Growth rate <br>
t = Time of growth<br>
e = Base of the natural logarithms<br>
Here ‘r’ is the relative growth rate and
also a measure of the ability of the plant to
produce new plant material, referred to as
efficiency index. Hence, the final size of \\(W_1\\)
depends on the initial size\\(W_0\\) <br>
**iii. Arithmetic and Geometric Growth of Embryo**
Plants often grow by a combination
of arithmetic and geometric growth
patterns. A young embryonic plant grows
geometrically and cell division becomes
restricted to certain cells at the tips of roots
and shoots. After this point, growth is of
the slower arithmetic type, but some of the
new cells that are produced can develop into
their mature condition and begin carrying
out specialized types of metabolism
(Figure 15.4). Plants are thus a mixture of
older, mature cells and young, dividing cells.<br>

**Figure 15.4:** Arithmetic and geometric growth of embryo<br>
Quantitative comparisons between the
growth of living system can also be made in
two ways and is explained in the table 1.
In figure 15.5, two leaves A and B are
drawn at a particular time. Then \\(A_1\\) and
\\(B_1\\)are drawn after a given time. A and
B = Area of leaves at a particular time.\\(A_1\\)
and B 1 = Area of leaves after a given time.
(\\(A_1\\) -A) and (\\(B_1\\) -B) represents an absolute
increase in area in the given time. Leaf A
increases from 5 cm 2 to 10 cm 2 ; 5 cm 2 in a
given time. Leaf B increases from 50 cm 2 to
55 cm 2 ; 5 cm 2 in a given time. Hence, both
leaves A and B increase their area by 5 cm 2
in a given time. This is absolute growth.
Relative growth is faster in leaf A because of
initial small size. It decreases with time.<br>
**Figure 15.5:** Diagrammatic comparision of absolute and relative growth rates  <br>               
**Measurement of Growth**
Experiment: 1. Arc auxanometer:
The increase in the length of the stem tip can
easily be measured by an arc auxanometer
which consists of a small pulley to the axis
of which is attached a long pointer sliding
over a graduated arc. A thread one end of
which is tied to the stem tip and another end
to a weight passes over the pulley tightly. As
soon as the stem tip increases in length, the
pulley moves and the pointer slide over the
graduated arc (Figure 15.6). The reading is
taken. The actual increase in the length of
the stem is then calculated by knowing the
length of the pointer and the radius of the
pulley. If the distance travelled by the pointer
is 10 and the radius of the pulley is 4 inches
and the length of the pint is 20 inches, the
actual grown is measured as follows:<br>
Actual growth in length = (Distance travelled by the pointer × radius of the pulley) / Length of the pointer.<br>
For example,
actual growth in length =
(10 × 4 inches)/ 20 inches = 2 inches <br>

#### 15.2 Plant Growth Regulators<br>
Plant Growth Regulators (chemical messenger)
are defined as organic substances which are
synthesized in minute quantities in one part of
the plant body and transported to another part
where they influence specific physiological
processes. Five major groups of hormones viz.,
auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene and
abscisic acid are presently known to coordinate
and regulate growth and development in plants.
The term phytohormones is implied to those
chemical substances which are synthesized by
plants and thus, naturally occurring. On the
other hand, there are several manufactured
chemicals which often resemble the hormones
in physiological action and
even in molecular structure.
Recently, another two groups,
the brassinosteroids and
polyamines were also known
to behave like hormones.<br>
**1. Plant growth regulators – classification**<br>
Plant Growth Regulators are classified as
natural and synthetic based on their source
and a detailed flow diagram is given in
Figure 15.7.<br>

**Figure 15.7:** Classification of Plant Growth
Regulators.<br>
**2. Characteristics of phytohormones**<br>
i. Usually produced in tips of roots, stems
and leaves.<br>
ii. Transfer of hormones from one place to
another takes part through conductive
systems.<br>
iii. They are required in trace quantities.<br>
iv. All hormones are organic in nature.<br>
v. There are no specialized cells or organs for
their secretion.<br>
vi. They are capable of influencing
physiological activities leading to
promotion, inhibition and modification
of growth.<br>
**3. Synergistic and Antagonistic effects**<br>
**i. Synergistic effects:** The effect of one or
more substance in such a way that both
promote each others activity. Example:
Activity of auxin and gibberellins or
cytokinins.<br>
**ii. Antagonistic effects:** The effect of two
substances in such a way that they have
opposite effects on the same process. One
accelerates and other inhibits. Example:
ABA and gibberellins during seed or bud
dormancy. ABA induces dormancy and
gibberellins break it.<br>
#### 15.2.1 Auxins <br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
During 1880, **Charles Darwin** noted the
unilateral growth and curvature of Canary
grass (Phalaris canariensis) coleoptile to light.
The term auxin (Greek: Auxin – to Grow) was
first used by F. W. Went in 1926 using Oats
(Avena) coleoptile and isolated the auxin. F. W.
Went in 1928 collected auxin in agar jelly. Kogl
and Haugen Smith (1931) isolated Auxin
from human urine, and called it as Auxin A.
Later on in 1934, similar active substances was
isolated from corn grain oil and was named as
Auxin B. Kogl et al., (1934) found heteroauxin
in the plant and chemically called it as Indole
Acetic Acid (IAA)
2. Occurrence
Auxin is generally produced by the growing
tips of the stem and root, from where they
migrate to the region of the action.
3. Types of Auxin
Auxins are divided into two categories Natural
auxins and Synthetic auxins.
