#### Chapter Outline

**4.1**. Inflorescence

**4.2**. Flower

**4.3**. Accessory organs

**4.4**. Androecium

**4.5**. Gynoecium

**4.6**.Construction of floral diagram

**4.7**. Fruits

**4.8**. Seed


Flowers have been a universal cultural
object for millennia. They are an important
aesthetic element in everyday life, and have
played a highly symbolic role in our culture
throughout the ages. Exchange of flowers
marks respect, affection, happiness, and love.
However, the biological purpose of the flower
is very different from the way we use and
perceive. Flower helps a plant to reproduce
its own kind. This chapter discusses flowers,
their arrangement, fruits and seeds which are
the reproductive units of a plant.



{{< box title="Floriculture" type="objective" >}}

Floriculture is a branch of Horticulture.
It deals with the cultivation of flowers
and ornamental crops. The Government
of India has identified floriculture as a
sunrise industry and accorded the status
of 100% export oriented. Agriculture
and Processed Food Product Export
Development Authority (APEDA) is
responsible for export promotion of
agricultural and horticultural products
from India.

##### 4.1 Inflorescence

Have you seen a bouquet being used during
functions? Group of flowers arranged
together on our preference is a bouquet. But
an inflorescence is a group of flowers arising
from a branched or unbranched axis with a
definite pattern. Function of inflorescence
is to display the flowers for effective
pollination and facilitate seed dispersal. The
grouping of flowers in one place gives a better
attraction to the visiting pollinators and
maximize the energy of the plant.


##### 4.1.1 Types of Inflorescence

**Based On Position**

Have you ever noticed the inflorescence
arising from different positions? Where is the
inflorescence present in a plant? Apex or axil?


Based on position of inflorescences, it may
be classified into three major types. They are,

**Terminal**: Inflorescence grows as a
part of the terminal shoot. Example: Raceme
of *Nerium oleander*

**Axillary**: Inflorescence presents in the
axile of the nearest vegetative leaf. Example:
*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*

**Cauliflorous**: Inflorescence developed di­
rectly from a woody trunk. Example: *Theobro*-
*ma cocoa*, *Couraupita guinensis*

Observe the inflorescence of Jackfruit and
Canon ball tree. Where does it arise?


##### 4.1.2 Based on branching pattern and other characters

Inflorescence may also be classified based
on branching, number and arrangement of
flowers, and some specialized structures.

I. **Indeterminate** (**Racemose**)

II. **Determinate** (**Cymose**)

III. **Mixed inflorescence**: Inflorescence
of some plants show a combination of
indeterminate and determinate pattern

IV. **Special inflorescence**: Inflorescence
which do not confine to these patterns

**I. Racemose**

The central axis of the inflorescence
(peduncle) possesses terminal bud which
is capable of growing continuously and
produce lateral flowers is called **Racemose**
**inflorescence**. Old flowers are at the base
and younger flowers and buds are towards
the apex. It is further divided into 3 types
based on growth pattern of main axis.

**1. Main axis elongated**

The axis of inflorescence is elongated and
contains pedicellate or sessile flowers on it. The
following types are discussed under main axis
elongated type.

**a. Simple raceme**: The inflorescence with
an unbranched main axis bears **pedicellate**
**flowers** in acropetal succession. Example:
*Crotalaria retusa, Mustard*.

**b. Spike**: Spike is an unbranched
indeterminate inflorescence with **sessile**
**flowers**. Example: *Achyranthes*.


**c. Spikelet**: Literally it is a small spike.
The Inflorescence is with branched central
axis. Each branch is a **spikelet**. Sessile flowers
are formed in acropetal succession on the axis.
A pair of inflorescence bracts called **glumes** is
present at the base. Each sessile flower has a
**lemma** (bract) and a **palea** (bracteole). Tepals
reduced to colourless scaly leaves (lodicule).
Each flower has stamen and pistil only.
Example: Paddy, Wheat.

**d. Catkin**: **Pendulous spikes** with a long
and drooping axis bearing small unisexual
or bisexual flowers. It is also called **ament**.
Example: *Acalypha hispida, Prosopis juliflora*.

**e. Spadix**: An inflorescence with a fleshy
or thickened central axis that possesses many
unisexual sessile flowers in acropetal succession.
Usually female flowers are found towards the
base and male flowers are found at the apex.
Entire inflorescence is covered by a brightly
coloured or hard bract called a **spathe**. Example:
*Amorphophallus, Colocasia*.

**f. Panicle**: A branched raceme is called
**panicle**. Example: *Mangifera*, neem. It is also
called **Compound raceme** or **Raceme of**
**Racemes**.
