We all eat food. If you do not take
breakfast in the morning how do you feel
by noon? The food we eat provides energy
and organic substances for growth and
for replacement of worn and damaged
tissues. It also regulates and coordinates
the various activities that take place in
our body. The components of our food are
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins,
minerals, fibre and water. We obtain food
from plant and animal sources. The food,
we eat are macromolecules and cannot
directly enter into our cells. These have
to be broken into smaller micromolecules
in absorbable forms, for which we need
a digestive system. Plants however are
autotrophs and synthesize their food,
hence they do not require a digestive
system. The primary function of the
digestive system in the animals is to bring
the nutrients, water and electrolytes from
the external environment into every
cell in the body through the circulatory
system.

### 5.1 Digestive system
The process of digestion involves intake
of the food (Ingestion), breakdown of the
food into micromolecules (Digestion),
absorption of these molecules into the
blood stream (Absorption), the absorbed
substances becoming components of
cells (Assimilation) and elimination of
the undigested substances (Egestion).
Digestive system includes the alimentary
canal and associated digestive glands.

##### 5.1.1 Structure of the alimentary canal

The alimentary canal is a continuous,
muscular digestive tract that begins with
an anterior opening, the mouth and
opens out posteriorly through the anus.
The alimentary canal consists of mouth,
buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus,
stomach, intestine, rectum and anus
(Figure. 5.1). The mouth is concerned
with the reception of food and leads to the
buccal cavity or oral cavity (Figure. 5.2).
Mechanical digestion is initiated in the buccal
cavity by chewing with the help of teeth and
tongue. Chemical digestion is through salivary
enzymes secreted by the salivary glands.
Each tooth is embedded in a socket
in the jaw bone this type of attachment
is called **thecodont**. Human beings and
many mammals form two sets of teeth
during their life time, a set of 20 temporary
milk teeth (deciduous teeth) which gets
replaced by a set of 32 permanent teeth
(adult teeth). This type of dentition is
called **diphyodont**. The permanent teeth
are of four different types (**heterodont**),
namely, Incisors (I) chisel like cutting
teeth, Canines (C) dagger shaped tearing
teeth, Pre molars (PM) for grinding, and
Molars (M) for grinding and crushing.
Arrangement of teeth in each half of the
upper and lower jaw, in the order of I, C,
PM and M can be represented by a dental
formula, in human the dental formula is

2123/2123 * 2

Mineral salts like calcium and
magnesium are deposited on the teeth and
form a hard layer of **‘tartar’ or calculus**
called plaque. If the plaque formed on
teeth is not removed regularly, it would
spread down the tooth into the narrow
gap between the gums and enamel and
causes inflammation called **gingivitis**,
which leads to redness and bleeding of the
gums and to bad smell. The hard chewing
surface of the teeth is made of enamel and
helps in mastication of food.
Tongue is a freely movable muscular
organ attached at the posterior end by
the frenulum to the floor of the buccal
cavity and is free in the front. It acts as a
universal tooth brush and helps in intake
food, chew and mix food with saliva, to
swallow food and also to speak. The upper
surface of the tongue has small projections
called papillae with taste buds.
The oral cavity leads into a short
common passage for food and air called
pharynx. The oesophagus and the trachea
(wind pipe) open into the pharynx. Food
passes into the oesophagus through a
wide opening called gullet at the back of
the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called
epiglottis prevents the entry of food into
the glottis (opening of trachea) during

  ![](/books/biology/unit-7/digestion/d3.png)

  swallowing. Two masses of lymphoid
tissue called tonsils are also located at the
sides of the pharynx.
Oesophagus is a thin long muscular
tube concerned with conduction of the
food to a ‘J’ shaped stomach passing
through the neck, thorax and diaphragm.
A cardiac sphincter (gastro oesphageal
sphincter) regulates the opening of
oesophagus into the stomach (Figure. 5.1).
If the cardiac sphincter does not contract
properly during the churning action of the
stomach the gastric juice with acid may
flow back into the oesophagus and cause
heart burn, resulting in **GERD** (Gastero
Oesophagus Reflex Disorder).
The stomach functions as the temporary
storage organ for food and is located in
the upper left portion of the abdominal
cavity. It consists of three parts – a cardiac
portion into which the oesophagus opens
a fundic portion and a pyloric portion that
opens into the duodenum. The opening
of the stomach into the duodenum is
guarded by the pyloric sphincter. It
periodically allows partially digested food
to enter the duodenum and also prevents
regurgitation of food. The inner wall of
stomach has many folds called **gastric**
**rugae** which unfolds to accommodate a
large meal.
   The small intestine assists in the final
digestion and absorption of food. It is the
longest part of the alimentary canal and
has three regions, a ‘U’ shaped duodenum
(25cm long), a long coiled middle portion
jejunum (2.4m long) and a highly coiled
ileum (3.5m long). The wall of the
duodenum has Brunner’s glands which
secrete mucus and enzymes. Ileum is
the longest part of the small intestine
and opens into the caecum of the large
intestine. The ileal mucosa has numerous
vascular projections called villi which are

![](/books/biology/unit-7/digestion/d4.png)
involved in the process of absorption and
the cells lining the villi produce numerous
microscopic projections called microvilli
giving a brush border appearance that
increase the surface area enormously.
Along with villi, the ileal mucosa also
contain mucus secreting goblet cells
and lymphoid tissue known as **Peyer’s**
**patches** which produce lymphocytes. The
wall of the small intestine bears crypts
between the base of villi called **crypts of**
**Leiberkuhn** (Figure.5.3).

##### 5.1.2 Histology of the Gut
The wall of the alimentary canal from
oesophagus to rectum consists of four
layers (Figure 5.5) namely **serosa**,
**muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa**.
The serosa (visceral peritoneum) is
the outermost layer and is made up of
thin squamous epithelium with some
connective tissues. Muscularis is made of
smooth circular and longitudinal muscle
fibres with a network of nerve cells and
parasympathetic nerve fibres which
controls peristalsis. The submucosal
layer is formed of loose connective tissue
containing nerves, blood, lymph vessels
and the sympathetic nerve fibres that
control the secretions of intestinal juice.
The innermost layer lining the lumen of
the alimentary canal is the mucosa which
secretes mucous.

##### 5.1.3 Digestive glands
Digestive glands are exocrine glands which
secrete biological catalysts called enzymes.
The digestive glands associated with the
alimentary canal are salivary glands, liver
and pancreas. Stomach wall has gastric
glands that secrete gastric juice and the
intestinal mucosa secretes intestinal juice.

**Salivary glands**
There are three pairs of salivary glands in
the mouth. They are the largest parotids
gland in the cheeks, the sub-maxillary/
sub-mandibular in the lower jaw and the
sublingual beneath the tongue. These
glands have ducts such as **Stenson’s duct**,
**Wharton’s duct and Bartholin’s duct or**
**duct of Rivinis** respectively (Figure. 5.6).
The salivary juice secreted by the salivary
glands reaches the mouth through these
ducts. The daily secretion of saliva from
salivary glands ranges from 1000 to 1500mL.

**Gastric glands**
The wall of the stomach is lined by
gastric glands. Chief cells or **peptic cells**
or **zymogen cells** in the gastric glands
secrete gastric enzymes and **Goblet cells**
secrete mucus. The **Parietal or oxyntic**
**cells** secrete HCl and an intrinsic factor
responsible for the absorption of Vitamin
B12 called **Castle’s intrinsic factor.**

**Liver**
The liver, the largest gland in our body
is situated in the upper right side of the
abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm.
The liver consists of two major left and right
lobes and two minor lobes. These lobes are
connected with diaphragm. Each lobe has
many hepatic lobules (functional unit of
liver) and is covered by a thin connective

![](/books/biology/unit-7/digestion/d8.png)

tissue sheath called the **Glisson’s capsule.**
Liver cells (hepatic cells) secrete bile which is
stored and concentrated in a thin muscular
sac called the gall bladder. The duct of gall
bladder (cystic duct) along with the hepatic
duct from the liver forms the common bile
duct. The bile duct passes downwards and
joins with the main pancreatic duct to form
a common duct called hepato-pancreatic
duct. The opening of the
hepato-pancreatic duct
into the duodenum is
guarded by a sphincter
called the **sphincter**
**of Oddi**(Figure.5.7).
Liver has high power of
regeneration and liver
cells are replaced by new
ones every 3-4 weeks.
Apart from bile
secretion, the liver
also performs several
functions
   * 1. Destroys aging and
defective blood cells
   * 2. Stores glucose in the form of glycogen
or disperses glucose into the blood
stream with the help of pancreatic
hormones
   * 3. Stores fat soluble vitamins and iron
   * 4. Detoxifies toxic substances.

   * 5. Involves in the synthesis of non-
essential amino acids and urea.

of liver has no digestive
enzyme but is very essential
for proper digestion of
food, especially of the fats.

**Pancreas**

The second largest gland in the digestive
system is the Pancreas, which is a yellow
coloured, compound elongated organ
consisting of exocrine and endocrine cells.
It is situated between the limbs of the ‘U’
shaped duodenum. The exocrine portion
secretes pancreatic juice containing
enzymes such as pancreatic amylase,
trypsin and pancreatic lipase and the
endocrine part called Islets of Langerhans,
secretes hormones such as insulin and
glucagon. The pancreatic duct directly
opens into the duodenum.

### 5.2 Digestion of food and role of digestive enzymes

The process of digestion converts the solid
food into absorbable and assimilable forms.
This is accomplished by mechanical and
chemical processes.

##### Digestion in the buccal cavity
The smell, sight and taste as well as the
mechanical stimulation of food in the
mouth, triggers a reflex action which results
in the secretion of saliva. The mechanical
digestion starts in the mouth by grinding
and chewing of food. It is called mastication.
The saliva contain water, electrolytes
salivary amylase (ptyalin),{{< box title="Learning objectives" type="objective" >}}
