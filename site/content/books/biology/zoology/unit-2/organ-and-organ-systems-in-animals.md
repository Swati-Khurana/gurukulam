### Introduction
From microbes to the blue whale,
organisms occur in different sizes and
shapes with a well organized organ
and organ systems. The basic tissues
(chapter-3) organize to form an organ
which in turn associates to form organ
systems in multicellular organisms. Such
an organization is essential for efficient
and better coordinated activities of
millions of cells constituting an organism.
You are being introduced to understand
the morphology and anatomy of three
organisms placed at different evolutionary
levels to show their organization and
functions. Morphology refers to the study
of form or externally visible features.
The word anatomy is used for the study
of internal organs in the animals. This
chapter deals with the morphology and
anatomy of invertebrates represented by
the earthworm and cockroach and the
vertebrates represented by the frog.

#### 4.1 Earthworm - Lampito mauritii

                **Classification**

                Phylum : Annelida
                Class : Oligochaeta
                Order : Haplotaxida
                Genus : Lampito
                Species : mauritii


Earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that
inhabits the upper layers of the moist soil, rich
in decaying organic matter. It is nocturnal
and during the day it lives in burrows made
by burrowing and swallowing the soil. In
gardens, they can be traced by their faecal
deposits known as worm castings on the
soil surface. Earthworms are considered
as “**Friends of Farmers**”. The common
Indian earthworms are Lampito mauritii
(Syn. Megascolex mauritii), Perioynx
excavatus and Metaphire posthuma (Syn.
Pheretima posthuma). Earthworms are
also conveniently classified based on their
ecological strategies as **epigeics** **anecics**
and **endogeics**  (Figure 4.1). Epigeics (Greek
for “up on the earth”) are surface dwellers,
eg. Perionyx excavatus and Eudrilus
eugeniae. Anecics (Greek for “outer layer
of the earth”) are found in upper layers of
the soil, eg. Lampito mauritii, Lumbricus
terrestris. Endogeics (Greek for “within the
earth”) are found in deeper layers of the soil
eg. Octochaetona thurstoni.

##### **Morphology**

Lampito mauritii is commonly found in Tamil
Nadu. It has a long and cylindrical narrow
body which is bilaterally symmetrical. L.
mauritii is 80 to 210 mm in length with a
diameter of 3.5 – 5 mm, and is light brown
in colour, with purplish tinge at the anterior
end. This colour of the earthworm is mainly
due to the presence of porphyrin pigment.
The body of the earthworm is encircled by a
large number of grooves which divides it into
a number of compartments called **segments**
or **metameres** (Figure 4.2). L. mauritii
consists of about 165 – 190 segments. The
dorsal surface of the body is marked by a
dark mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel)
along the longitudinal axis of the body.
The ventral surface is distinguished by the
presence of genital openings. The mouth is
found in the centre of the first segment of the
body, called the **peristomium**. Overhanging
the mouth is a small flap called the upper lip
or **prostomium**. The last segment has the
anus called the **pygidium**. In mature worms,
segments 14 to 17 may be found swollen with
a glandular thickening of the skin called the
clitellum. This helps in the formation of the
cocoon. Due to the presence of **clitellum**,
the body of an earthworm is divided into
pre clitellar region (1st – 13th segments),
clitellar region (14th – 17th segments) and
the post – clitellar region (after the 17th
segment). In all the segments of the body
except the first, last and clitellum, there is
a ring of chitinous body setae. This body
setae arises from a setigerous sac of the skin
and it is curved as **S** – shaped. Setae can be
protruded or retracted and their principal
role is in locomotion.
The external apertures are the mouth,
anus, dorsal pores, spermathecal openings,
genital openings and nephridiopores. The
dorsal pores are present from the 10th segment
onwards. The coelomic fluid communicates
to the exterior through these pores and keeps
the body surface moist and free from harmful
microorganisms. Spermathecal openings are
three pairs of small ventrolateral apertures

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic2.png)

lying intersegmentally between the grooves
of the segments 6/7, 7/8 and 8/9. A pair of
female genital apertures lie on the ventral side
in the 14th segment and a pair of male genital
apertures are situated latero-ventrally in the
18th segment. Nephridiopores are numerous
and found throughout the body of the
earthworm except a few anterior segments,
through which the metabolic wastes are
eliminated.

**Table 4.1**: **Morphological** **and anatomical** **differences between Lampito mauritii and Metaphire posthuma**





##### Anatomy
The body wall of the earthworm is very
moist, thin, soft, skinny, elastic and
consists of the cuticle, epidermis, muscles
and coelomic epithelium. The epidermis
consists of supporting cells, gland cells, basal
cells and sensory cells. A spacious body
cavity called the **coelom** is seen between
the alimentary canal and the body wall.
The coelom contains the coelomic fluid
and serves as a **hydrostatic skeleton**, in
which the coelomocytes are known to play
a major role in regeneration, immunity
and wound healing. The coelomic fluid
of the earthworm is milky and alkaline,
which consists of granulocytes or eleocytes,
amoebocytes, mucocytes and leucocytes.

##### Digestive system

The digestive system of the earthworm
consists of the alimentary canal and the
digestive glands. The alimentary canal
runs as a straight tube throughout the
length of the body from the mouth to anus
(Figure 4. 3).
The **mouth** opens into the **buccal cavity**
which occupies the 1st and 2nd segments.
The buccal cavity leads into a thick
**muscular pharynx**, which occupies the 3rd
and 4th segments and is surrounded by the
**pharyngeal glands**. A small narrow tube,
oesophagus lies in the 5th segment and
continues into a muscular **gizzard** in the 6th
segment. The gizzard helps in the grinding
of soil particles and decaying leaves.
Intestine starts from the 7th segment and
continues till the last segment. The dorsal
wall of the **intestine** is folded into the cavity
as the **typhlosole**. This fold contains blood
vessels and increases the absorptive area of
the intestine. The inner epithelium consists

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic3.png)

of columnar cells and glandular cells. The
alimentary canal opens to the exterior
through the anus.
The ingested organic rich soil passes
through the digestive tract where
digestive enzymes breakdown complex
food into smaller absorbable units. The
simpler molecules are absorbed through
the intestinal membrane and are utilized.
The undigested particles along with earth
are passed out through the anus, as **wormcastings** or **vermicasts**. The pharyngeal

##### Intestinal Caeca
In Metaphire posthuma, the 26th segment
has a pair of short conical out growths
called intestinal caecae. It is extended
anteriorly up to the 22nd segment. These
are digestive glands and secrete an
amylolytic enzyme for the digestion of
starch. Intestinal caecae are not present
in many species of earthworms such as
the Lampito mauritii.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic4.png)

or salivary gland cells and the glandular
cells of the intestine are supposed to be the
digestive glands which secrete digestive
enzymes for digestion of food.

##### Respiratory System
The earthworm has no special respiratory
organs like lungs or gills. Respiration takes
place through the body wall. The outer
surface of the skin is richly supplied with
blood capillaries which aid in the diffusion
of gases. Oxygen diffuses through the skin
into the blood while carbon dioxide from
the blood diffuses out. The skin is kept
moist by mucous and coelomic fluid and
facilitates exchange of gases.

##### Circulatory system

Lampito mauritii exhibits a closed type
of blood vascular system consisting of
blood vessels, capillaries and lateral hearts
(Figure 4.4). Two median longitudinal
vessels run above and below the alimentary
canal as dorsal and ventral vessels of
the earthworm. There are paired valves
in the dorsal vessels which prevent the
backward flow of the blood. The ventral
vessel has no valves and is non contractile,
allowing the backward flow of blood. In
the anterior part of the body the dorsal
vessel is connected with the ventral vessel
by eight pairs of **commissural vessels** or
the **lateral hearts** lying in the 6th to 13th
segments. These vessels run on either
side of the alimentary canal and pump
blood from the dorsal vessel to the ventral
vessel. The dorsal vessel receives blood
from various organs in the body. The
ventral vessel supplies blood to the various
organs. Blood glands are present in the
anterior segments of the earthworm. They
produce blood cells and haemoglobin
which is dissolved in the plasma and gives
red colour to the blood.

##### Nervous System
The bilobed mass of nervous tissue
called supra - pharyngeal ganglia, lies on
the dorsal wall of the pharynx in the 3rd
segment, is referred as the “brain”. The
ganglion found below the pharynx in the
4th segment is called the sub-pharyngeal
ganglion (Figure. 4.4). The brain and the
sub - pharyngeal ganglia
are connected by a pair
of circum-pharyngeal
connectives. They run one
on each side of the pharynx.
Thus a nerve ring is formed
around the anterior region
of the alimentary canal. The
double ventral nerve cord
runs backward from the
sub - pharyngeal ganglion.
The brain along with
other nerves in the ring
integrates sensory inputs
and command muscular
responses of the body.
The earthworm’s
receptors are stimulated
by a group of slender 
columnar cells connected with nerves.
The **Photoreceptors** (sense of light) are
found on the dorsal surface of the body.
**Gustatory** (sense of taste) and **olfactory
receptors** (sense of smell) are found
in the buccal cavity. **Tactile receptors**
(sense of touch), **chemoreceptors** (detect
chemical changes) and **thermoreceptors**
(changes in temperature) are present in
the prostomium and the body wall.

##### Excretory System

Excretion is the process of elimination of
metabolic waste products from the body.
In earthworm, excretion is effected by
segmentally arranged, minute coiled, paired
tubules called nephridia. There are three

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic6.png)

types of nephridia; (i) **pharyngeal or**
**tufted nephridia**  – present as paired
tufts in the 5th - 9th segments (ii)
**Micronephridia** or **Integumentary**
**nephridia**  – attached to the lining of
the body wall from the14th segment
to the last which open on the body
surface (iii) **Meganephridia** or
**septal nephridia** – present as pair
on both sides of intersegmental septa
of the 19th segment to the last and
open into intestine (Figure 4.5). The
meganephridium has an internal
funnel like opening called the
nephrostome, which is fully ciliated.
The nephrostome is in the preceding
segment and the rest of the tube is in
the succeeding segment. This tube
consists of three distinct divisions,
the ciliated, the glandular and the
muscular region. The waste material
collected through the ciliated funnel is
pushed into the muscular part of nephridium
by the ciliated region. The glandular part
extracts the waste from the blood and finally
the wastes exit out through the nephridiopore.
Besides nephridia, special cells on
the coelomic wall of the intestine, called
chloragogen cells are present. They extract
the nitrogenous waste from the blood of the
intestinal wall, into the body cavity to be
sent out through the nephridia.

##### Reproductive System
Earthworms are hermaphrodites or
monoecious i.e. male and female reproductive
organs are found in the same individual
(Figure 4. 6). Self fertilization is avoided
because two sex organs mature at different
times, which means the sperm develops earlier
than the production of ova (**Protandrous**).
Thus cross fertilization takes place.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic7.png)

In the male reproductive system, two
pairs of testes are present in the 10th and 11th
segments. The testes give rise to the **germ**
**cells or spermatogonia**, which develops
into spermatozoa in the two pairs of seminal
vesicles. Two pairs of seminal funnels called
**ciliary rosettes** are situated in the same
segments as the testes. The ciliated funnels
of the same side are connected to a long tube
called **vas deferens**. The **vasa deferentia**
run upto the 18th segment where they open
to the exterior through the **male genital**
**aperture**. The male genital aperture contains
two pairs of **penial setae** for copulation. A
pair of prostate glands lies in the 18th – 19th
segments. The secretion of the prostate
gland serves to cement the spermatozoa into
bundles known as **spermatophores**.

The female
r e p r o d u c t i v e
system consists of
a pair of ovaries
lying in the 13th
segment. Each
ovary has finger
like projections
which contain ova
in linear series.
Ovarian funnels
are present beneath
the **ovaries** which
continue into the
**oviducts**. They
open as a pair of
genital apertures
on the ventral side of the 14th segment.
Spermathecae or seminal receptacles
are three pairs lying in segments 7th,
8th and 9th, opening to the exterior on
the ventral side between 6th & 7th, 7th &
8th and 8th & 9th segments. They receive
spermatozoa from the partner and store
during copulation.

**Regeneration**
Earthworms have most of their
important organ in the first
20 segments. If earthworm gets cut after
the 20th segment, the anterior half can
regenerate, while the posterior half shall
disintegrate after some time.

A mutual exchange of sperms occurs
between two worms during mating. One
worm has to find another worm and
they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal
openings, exchanging the sperms.
Mature egg cells in the nutritive fluid
are deposited in the cocoons produced

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic8.png)
by the gland cells of the clitellum which
also collects the partner’s sperms from
the spermthecae. Fertilization and
development occurs within the cocoons,
which are deposited in the soil. After
about 2 – 3 weeks, each cocoon produces
baby earthworms. Development is
direct and no larva is formed during development.

**Life cycle**

Lampito mauritii begins its life cycle, from
the fertilized eggs. The eggs are held in a
protective cocoon. These cocoons have
an incubation period of about 14- 18 days
after which they hatch to release **juveniles**
(Figure 4.7). The juveniles undergo changes
into **non-clitellate** forms in phase – I after
about 15 days, which then develops a
**clitellum**, called the **clitellate** at the end of
the growth phase – II taking 15 - 17 days
to complete. During the reproductive stage,
earthworms copulate, and later shed their
cocoons in the soil after about 10 days. The
life cycle of Lampito mauritii takes about 60
days to complete.
