into squamous epithelium, cuboidal
epithelium, columnar epithelium, ciliated
epithelium and pseudostratified epithelium
(Figure 3.2). The **squamous epithelium**  is
made of a single thin layer of flattened cells
with irregular boundaries. They are found
in the kidney glomeruli, air sacs of lungs,
lining of heart,**blood** vessels and lymphatic
vessels and are involved in functions like
forming a diffusion boundary and filtration
in sites where protection is not important.
The **"cuboidal epithelium"** is made of a
single layer of cube like cells. This tissue
is commonly found in the kidney tubules,
ducts and secretory portions of small glands
and surface of the ovary. Its main functions
are secretion and absorption. The columnar
epithelium is composed of single layer of tall
cells with round to oval nuclei at the base. It
lines the digestive tract from the stomach to
 the rectum. The two modifications of this
lining are the presence of microvilli on the
apical surface of the absorptive cells and
Goblet cell which secretes the protective
lubricating mucus. The functions of this
epithelium include absorption, secretion
of mucus, enzymes and other substances.
If the columnar cells bear cilia on their free
surfaces they are called ciliated epithelium.
This ciliated type propels mucus by ciliary
actions and it lines the small bronchioles,
fallopian tubes and uterus. Nonciliated
type lines most of the digestive tract, gall
bladder and secretory ducts of glands.
Pseudo-stratified epithelial cells are
columnar, but unequal in size. Although the
epithelium is single layered yet it appears
to be multi-layered because the nuclei lie at
different levels in different cells. Hence, it is
also called pseudostratified                                                 
epithelium and
