Kingdom Animalia comprises
millions of animal species and studying
them without a basic classification may
lead to confusion. In addition to this, there
are several new species of animals being
constantly discovered. Classification is
very essential for identification, naming
and assigning a systematic position to
the newly discovered species. Animal
Kingdom is classified mainly based on the
closely resembling characteristic features.
Kingdom Animalia is characterised of
eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic
organisms. They include about 35 phyla
of which 11 are considered as major
phyla. Almost 99 percent of animals
are invertebrates or animals without
backbone. The remaining represents
vertebrates or animals with backbone.
On the basis of the presence or absence
of notochord (vertebral column), animals
are also categorised into two major groups
and they are non chordates and chordates.

### **Basis of classification**
Multicellular organisms are structurally
and functionally different but yet they
possess certain common fundamental
features such as the arrangement of cell
layers, the levels of organisation, nature
of coelom, the presence or absence
of segmentation, notochord and the
organisation of the organ system.

#### Levels of organisation
All members of Kingdom Animalia are
metazoans (multicellular animals) and exhibit
different patterns of cellular organisation.
The cells of the metazoans are not capable of
independent existence and exhibit division of
labour. Among the metazoans, cells may be
functionally isolated or similar kinds of cells
may be grouped together to form tissues,
organ and organ systems.

#### Cellular level of organisation
This basic level of organisation is seen
in sponges. The cells in the sponges are
arranged as loose aggregates and do not
form tissues, i.e. they exhibit cellular level
of organisation. There is division of labour
among the cells and different types of cells
are functionally isolated. In sponges, the
outer layer is formed of pinacocytes (plate-
like cells that maintain the size and structure
of the sponge) and the inner layer is formed
of choanocytes. These are flagellated
collar cells that create and maintain water
flow through the sponge thus facilitating
respiratory and digestive functions.

Animals such as sponges lack
nervous tissue and muscle tissue, what
does this tell you about sponges?

##### Tissue level of organisation
In some animals, cells that perform
similar functions are aggregated to form
tissues. The cells of a tissue integrate in a
highly coordinated fashion to perform a
common function, due to the presence of
nerve cells and sensory cells. This tissue level
of organisation is exhibited in diploblastic
animals like cnidarians. The formation of
tissues is the first step towards evolution of
body plan in animals (Hydra - Coelenterata).
##### Organ level of organisation
Different kinds of tissues aggregate
to form an organ to perform a specific
function. Organ level of organisation is a
further advancement over the tissue level
of organisation and appears for the first
time in the Phylum Platyhelminthes and
seen in other higher phyla.
##### Organ system level of organisation
The most efficient and highest level of
organisation among the animals is exhibited
by flatworms, nematodes, annelids,
arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and
chordates. The evolution of mesoderm in
these animals has led to their structural
complexity. The tissues are organised to
form organs and organ systems. Each
system is associated with a specific
function and show organ system level of
organisation. Highly specialized nerve and
sensory cells coordinate and integrate the
functions of the organ systems, which can
be very primitive and simple or complex
depending on the individual animal.
For example, the digestive system of
Platyhelminthes has only a single opening
to the exterior which serves as both mouth
and anus, and hence called an **incomplete
digestive system**. From Aschelminthes to
Chordates, all animals have a **complete
digestive system** with two openings, the
mouth and the anus.

Similarly, the circulatory system is
of two types, the **open type:** in which
the blood remains filled in tissue spaces
due to the absence of blood capillaries.
(arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and
urochordates) and the **closed type:** in
which the blood is circulated through
blood vessels of varying diameters
(arteries, veins and capillaries) as
in annelids, cephalochordates and vertebrates.

#### Diploblastic and Triploblastic organisation
During embryonic development, the
tissues and organs of animals originate
from two or three embryonic germ layers.
On the basis of the origin and develop-
ment, animals are classified into two cate-
gories: Diploblastic and Triploblastic.

Animals in which the cells are arranged
in two embryonic layers (Figure 2.1), the
external ectoderm, and internal endoderm are
called **diploblastic animals**. In these animals
the ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis (the
outer layer of the body wall) and endoderm
gives rise to gastrodermis (tissue lining the
gut cavity). An undifferentiated layer present
between the ectoderm and endoderm is the
mesoglea. (Corals, Jellyfish, Sea anemone)

Animals in which the developing
embryo has three germinal layers are called
triploblastic animals and consists of outer
ectoderm (skin, hair, neuron, nail, teeth,
etc), inner endoderm (gut, lung, liver) and
middle mesoderm (muscle, bone, heart).
Most of the triploblastic animals show
organ system level of organisation (Flat
worms to Chordates).

#### Patterns of symmetry
Symmetry is the body arrangement in
which parts that lie on opposite side of an
axis are identical. An animal’s body plan
results from the animal’s pattern of devel-
opment. The simplest body plan is seen in
sponges (Figure 2.2). They do not display
symmetry and are **asymmetryical**. Such
animals lack a definite body plan or are
irregular shaped and any plane passing
through the centre of the body does not
divide them into two equal halves (Spong-
es). An asymmetrical body plan is also
seen in adult gastropods (snails).
