* Justifies the need for
classification.
* Understands the salient
features of the animal
phyla.

{{< /box >}}

Kingdom Animalia comprises
millions of animal species and studying
them without a basic classification may
lead to confusion. In addition to this, there
are several new species of animals being
constantly discovered. Classification is
very essential for identification, naming
and assigning a systematic position to
the newly discovered species. Animal
Kingdom is classified mainly based on the
closely resembling characteristic features.
Kingdom Animalia is characterised of
eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic
organisms. They include about 35 phyla
of which 11 are considered as major
phyla. Almost 99 percent of animals
are invertebrates or animals without
backbone. The remaining represents
vertebrates or animals with backbone.
On the basis of the presence or absence
of notochord (vertebral column), animals
are also categorised into two major groups
and they are non chordates and chordates.

### **Basis of classification**
Multicellular organisms are structurally
and functionally different but yet they
possess certain common fundamental
features such as the arrangement of cell
layers, the levels of organisation, nature
of coelom, the presence or absence
of segmentation, notochord and the
organisation of the organ system.

#### Levels of organisation
All members of Kingdom Animalia are
metazoans (multicellular animals) and exhibit
different patterns of cellular organisation.
The cells of the metazoans are not capable of
independent existence and exhibit division of
labour. Among the metazoans, cells may be
functionally isolated or similar kinds of cells
may be grouped together to form tissues,
organ and organ systems.

#### Cellular level of organisation
This basic level of organisation is seen
in sponges. The cells in the sponges are
arranged as loose aggregates and do not
form tissues, i.e. they exhibit cellular level
of organisation. There is division of labour
among the cells and different types of cells
are functionally isolated. In sponges, the
outer layer is formed of pinacocytes (plate-
like cells that maintain the size and structure
of the sponge) and the inner layer is formed
of choanocytes. These are flagellated
collar cells that create and maintain water
flow through the sponge thus facilitating
respiratory and digestive functions.

Animals such as sponges lack
nervous tissue and muscle tissue, what
does this tell you about sponges?

{{< /box >}}

##### Tissue level of organisation
In some animals, cells that perform
similar functions are aggregated to form
tissues. The cells of a tissue integrate in a
highly coordinated fashion to perform a
common function, due to the presence of
nerve cells and sensory cells. This tissue level
of organisation is exhibited in diploblastic
animals like cnidarians. The formation of
tissues is the first step towards evolution of
body plan in animals (Hydra - Coelenterata).
##### Organ level of organisation
Different kinds of tissues aggregate
to form an organ to perform a specific
function. Organ level of organisation is a
further advancement over the tissue level
of organisation and appears for the first
time in the Phylum Platyhelminthes and
seen in other higher phyla.
##### Organ system level of organisation
The most efficient and highest level of
organisation among the animals is exhibited
by flatworms, nematodes, annelids,
arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and
chordates. The evolution of mesoderm in
these animals has led to their structural
complexity. The tissues are organised to
form organs and organ systems. Each
system is associated with a specific
function and show organ system level of
organisation. Highly specialized nerve and
sensory cells coordinate and integrate the
functions of the organ systems, which can
be very primitive and simple or complex
depending on the individual animal.
For example, the digestive system of
Platyhelminthes has only a single opening
to the exterior which serves as both mouth
and anus, and hence called an **incomplete
digestive system**. From Aschelminthes to
Chordates, all animals have a **complete
digestive system** with two openings, the
mouth and the anus.

Similarly, the circulatory system is
of two types, the **open type:** in which
the blood remains filled in tissue spaces
due to the absence of blood capillaries.
(arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and
urochordates) and the **closed type:** in
which the blood is circulated through
blood vessels of varying diameters
(arteries, veins and capillaries) as
in annelids, cephalochordates and vertebrates.

#### Diploblastic and Triploblastic organisation
During embryonic development, the
tissues and organs of animals originate
from two or three embryonic germ layers.
On the basis of the origin and develop-
ment, animals are classified into two cate-
gories: Diploblastic and Triploblastic.

Animals in which the cells are arranged
in two embryonic layers (Figure 2.1), the
external ectoderm, and internal endoderm are
called **diploblastic animals**. In these animals
the ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis (the
outer layer of the body wall) and endoderm
gives rise to gastrodermis (tissue lining the
gut cavity). An undifferentiated layer present
between the ectoderm and endoderm is the
mesoglea. (Corals, Jellyfish, Sea anemone)

Animals in which the developing
embryo has three germinal layers are called
triploblastic animals and consists of outer
ectoderm (skin, hair, neuron, nail, teeth,
etc), inner endoderm (gut, lung, liver) and
middle mesoderm (muscle, bone, heart).
Most of the triploblastic animals show
organ system level of organisation (Flat
worms to Chordates).

**Figure 2.1 Germinal layers**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/germinal-layers.png "kingdom animania")

#### Patterns of symmetry
Symmetry is the body arrangement in
which parts that lie on opposite side of an
axis are identical. An animal’s body plan
results from the animal’s pattern of devel-
opment. The simplest body plan is seen in
sponges (Figure 2.2). They do not display
symmetry and are **asymmetryical**. Such
animals lack a definite body plan or are
irregular shaped and any plane passing
through the centre of the body does not
divide them into two equal halves (Spong-
es). An asymmetrical body plan is also
seen in adult gastropods (snails).

**Figure 2.2 Asymmetry in sponges**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

Symmetrical animals have paired body
parts that are arranged on either side of
a plane passing through the central axis.
When any plane passing through the
central axis of the body divides an organism
into two identical parts, it is called radial
symmetry. Such **radially symmetrical**
animals have a top and bottom side but
no dorsal (back) and ventral (abdomen)
side, no right and left side. They have a
body plan in which the body parts are
organised in a circle around an axis. It
is the principal symmetry in diploblastic
animals. Cnidarians such as sea anemone
and corals (Figure 2.3) are radially
symmetrical. However, triploblastic
animals like echinoderms (e.g., starfish)
have five planes of symmetry and show
**Pentamerous radial symmetry**.
Animals which possess two pairs
of symmetrical sides are said to be
biradially symmetrical (Figure 2.4).
Biradial symmetry is a combination of
radial and bilateral symmetry as seen in
ctenophores. There are only two planes of
symmetry, one through the longitudinal
and sagittal axis and the other through
the longitudinal and transverse axis. (e.g.,
Comb jellyfish – Pleurobrachia)
Animals which have two similar
halves on either side of the central plane
show bilateral symmetry (Figure 2.5).
It is an advantageous type of symmetry
in triploblastic animals, which helps in
seeking food, locating mates and escaping

**Figure 2.5 Bilateral symmetry in Insects**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

from predators more efficiently. Animals
that have dorsal and ventral sides, anterior
and posterior ends, right and left sides
are bilaterally symmetrical and exhibit
cephalisation, in which the sensory and
brain structures are concentrated at the
anterior end of the animal.

#### Coelom
The presence of body cavity or coelom
is important in classifying animals. Most
animals possess a body cavity between the
body wall and the alimentary canal, and is
lined with mesoderm (Figure 2.6)

Animals which do not possess a body
cavity are called **acoelomates**. Since there
is no body cavity in these animals their
body is solid without a perivisceral cavity,
this restricts the free movement of internal
organs. (e.g., Flatworms)

In some animals, the body cavity is not
fully lined by the mesodermal epithelium, but
the mesoderm is formed as scattered pouches
between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such
a body cavity is called a **pseudocoel** and is
filled with pseudocoelomic fluid. Animals
that possess a pseudocoel are called
**pseudocoelomates** e.g., Round worms. The
pseudocoelomic fluid in the pseudocoelom
acts as a hydrostatic skeleton and allows free
movement of the visceral organs and for
circulation of nutrients.

**Eucoelom** or true coelom is a fluid-
filled cavity that develops within the
mesoderm and is lined by mesodermal
epithelium called peritoneum. Such
animals with a true body cavity are called
coelomates or eucoelomates. Based on
the mode of formation of coelom, the
eucoelomates are classified into two types,
**Schizocoelomates** – in these animals the

**Figure 2.6 Diagrammatic representation of coelom in animals**


![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

body cavity is formed by splitting of
mesoderm. (e.g., annelids, arthropods,
molluscs). In **Enterocoelomate animals**
the body cavity is formed from the
mesodermal pouches of archenteron.
(e.g., Echinoderms, hemichordates and
chordates) (Figure 2.7).

**Figure 2.7 Development of
Schizocoelomata and Enterocoelomata**


![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

#### Segmentation and Notochord
In some animals, the body is externally
and internally divided into a series of
repeated units called segments with a serial
repetition of some organs (**Metamerism**).
The simplest form of segmentation is 
found in Annelids in which each unit of
the body is very similar to the next one. But
in arthropods (cockroach), the segments
may look different and has different
functions.

Animals which possess notochord at
any stage of their development are called
chordates. Notochord is a mesodermally
derived rod like structure formed on the
dorsal side during embryonic development
in some animals. Based on the presence
or absence of notochord, animals are
classified as chordates (Cephalochordates,
Urochordates, Pisces to Mammalia) and
nonchordates (Porifera to Hemichordata).

### **Classification of Kingdom Animalia**
Animal kingdom is divided into two
sub-kingdoms, the Parazoa and Eumetazoa
based on their organisation.

**1. Parazoa**: These include the
multicellular sponges and their cells are
loosely aggregated and do not form tissues
or organs.
**2. Eumetazoa:** These include multicellular
animals with well defined tissues, which
are organised as organs and organ systems.
Eumetazoans includes two taxonomic
levels called grades. They include **Radiata**
and **Bilateria**.

**Figure 2.8 Classification of Kingdom Animalia based on common fundamental features**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

#### Grade 1: Radiata
Among the eumetazoa, a few animals
have an organisation of two layers of cells,
the outer ectoderm and inner endoderm,
separated by a jelly like mesoglea. They are
radially symmetrical and are diploblastic.
Examples: Cnidarians (sea anemone, jelly
fish) and Ctenophores (comb jellies).

#### Grade 2: Bilateria
The eumetazoans other than Radiata,
show organ level of organisation and are
bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic.
The grade Bilateria includes two
taxonomic levels called Division.

#### Division 1: Protostomia
(Proto: first; stomium: mouth)
Protostomia includes the
eumetazoans in which the embryonic
blastopore develops into mouth. This
division includes three subdivisions
namely **acoelomata, pseudocoelomata
and schizocoelomata**.

#### Division 2: Deuterostomia
(deuteron: secondary; stomium: mouth)
Eumetazoans in which anus is formed
from or near the blastopore and the mouth is
formed away from the blastopore. It includes
only one subdivision **Enterocoelomata**.
They have a true coelom called enterocoel,
formed from the archenteron.

### **Non Chordates (Invertebrata)**
#### Phylum: Porifera
(L. poros-pore; ferre-to bear)
These pore bearing animals are
commonly called **sponges**. They are aquatic,
mostly marine, asymmetrical and a few
species live in freshwaters. They are primitive,
multicellular, sessile animals with cellular
level of organisation in which the cells are
loosely arranged. They are either radially
symmetrical or asymmetrical animals.

They possess a water transport system
or **canal system** where water enters through
minute pores called **ostia** lining the body
wall through which the water enters into a
central cavity (spongocoel) and goes out
through the osculum. This water transport
system is helpful in food gathering,
circulation, respiration and removal of
waste. **Choanocytes** or collar cells are
special flagellated cells lining the spongocoel
and the canals. The body is supported by a
skeleton made up of calcareous andsiliceous
**spicules or spongin** or both. Nutrition is
holozoic and intracellular. All sponges are
hermaphrodites (i.e.) the ova and sperms
are produced by the same individual. They
also reproduce asexually by fragmentation
or **gemmule formation** and sexually by
the formation of gametes. Development is
indirect with different types of larval stages
such as **parenchymula and amphiblastula**.

Examples: Sycon (Scypha), Spongilla
(fresh water sponge), Euspongia (bath
sponge) Euplectella (Venus flower basket)
(Figure 2.9).

The underwater sea bed is the
new habitat where the discovery and
development of Marine Pharmaceuticals
are in peak. Anticancerous, Antimalarial
drugs and other bioactive molecules have
been isolated and tested successfully.

{{< /box >}}

#### Phylum: Cnidaria
(G. knode -needle or sting cells)

Cnidarians (were previously called
Coelenterata), are aquatic, sessile or free
swimming, solitary or colonial forms with
radial symmetry The name Cnidaria is
derived from **cnidocytes or cnidoblasts** with
**stinging cells** or **nematocyst** on tentacles.
Cnidoblasts are used for anchorage, defense,
and to capture the prey. Cnidarians are the
first group of animals to exhibit tissue level
organisation and are diploblastic. They have
a central vascular cavity or **coelenteron**
(serves both digestion and circulatory
function) with a single opening called mouth
or hypostome, which serves the process of
ingestion and egestion. Digestion is both
extracellular and intracellular. The nervous
system is primitive and is formed of diffused
nerve net. Cnidarians like corals have a
skeleton made up of calcium carbonate.
Cnidarians exhibit two basic body forms,
polyp and medusa. The **polyp** forms are
sessile and cylindrical (e.g. Hydra, Adamsia),
whereas the **medusa** are umbrella shaped
and free swimming. Cnidarians which exist

**Figure 2.10 Examples of Cnidarians**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

in both forms, also exhibit alternation of
generations in their life cycle (**Metagenesis**).
The polyp represents the asexual generation
and medusa represents the sexual generation.
Polyps produce medusa asexually and
medusa forms polyps sexually. Development
is indirect and includes a free swimming
ciliated **planula larva**.
Examples: Physalia (Portugese man of
war), Adamsia (Sea anemone), Pennatula
(Sea pen), Meandrina (Brain coral)
(Figure 2.10).

disadvantages of direct and indirect
development.

#### Phylum: Ctenophora
(G. Ktenos -comb; phoros -bearing)
  
    Ctenophora are exclusively marine,
biradially symmetrical, diploblastic
animals with tissue level of organisation.
Though they are diploblastic, their
mesoglea is different from that of cnidaria.
It contains amoebocytes and smooth
muscle cells. They have eight external rows
of ciliated comb plates (comb jellies) which
help in locomotion, hence commonly
called comb jellies or sea walnuts.
Bioluminescence (the ability of a living
organism to emit light) is well marked
in ctenophores. They lack nematocysts
but possess special cells called lasso
cells or colloblasts which help in food
capture. Digestion is both extracellular
and intracellular. Sexes are not separate
(monoecious). They reproduce only by
sexual means. Fertilization is external
and development is indirect and includes
a larval stage called cydippid larva. e.g.,
Pleurobrachia (Figure 2.11).

**Figure 2.11 Example of Ctenophora-
Pleurobrachia**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

Phylum: Platyhelminthes
(Flatworms)
(G. Platy -broad or flat; helmin-worm)
They have a dorsoventrally flattened
body and hence called flatworms. These
animals are bilaterally symmetrical,
triploblastic, acoelomate with organ
system level of organisation. They show
moderate cephalization and unidirectional
movement. They are, mostly endoparasites
of animals including human beings. Hooks
and suckers are present in the parasitic
forms and serve as organs of attachment.
Their body is not segmented, but some
exhibit pseudosegmentation. Some of
the parasitic flatworms absorb nutrients
directly from the host through their body
surface. However, flatworms like liver
fluke have an incomplete digestive system.
Specialized excretory cells called **flame**
**cells** help in osmoregulation and excretion.
Sexes are not separate (monoecious);
fertilisation is internal and development
is through larval stages (miracidium,
sporocyst, redia, cercaria). **Polyembryony**

**Figure 2.12 Examples of Platyhelminthes**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

is common in some flatworms (Liver
flukes). Some members like Planaria show
high regeneration capacity ( Figure 2.12).
Examples: Taenia solium (Tape
worm), Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke),
Schistosoma (Blood fluke).

#### Phylum: Aschelminthes (Round Worms)
(G. Askes –cavity; helminths – worms)

Previously called
Nematoda, this phylum
is now named as
Aschelminthes. The body
of these worms is circular
(round) in cross section
and hence are called round worms. They
are free living or parasitic on aquatic and
terrestrial plants and animals. They are
bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and
pseudocoelomate animals with organ
system level of organisation. The body is
unsegmented and covered by a transparent,

**Figure 2.13 Examples of Aschelminthes**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

tough and protective collagenous layer called
cuticle. The alimentary canal is complete
with a well developed mouth, muscular
pharynx and anus. Excretory system consists
of renette glands. Sexes are separate; and
exhibit sexual dimorphism; often females are
longer than males. Fertilisation is internal;
majority are oviparous (e.g. Ascaris) few are
ovoviviparous (Wuchereria). Development
may be direct or indirect.

Examples. Ascaris lumbricoides (Round
worm), Enterobius vermicularis (Pin worm),
Wuchereria bancrofti (Filarial worm),
Ancylostomaa deuodenale (Hook worm)
(Figure 2.13).

#### Phylum: Annelida(Segmented worm)
(L. annulus -a ring, and G. edios- form)

Annelids were the first segmented
animals to evolve. They are aquatic
or terrestrial, free living but some are
parasitic. They are triploblastic, bilaterally

**Figure 2.14 Examples of Annelida**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

symmetrical, schizocoelomates and exhibit
organ system level of body organisation.
The coelom with coelomic fluid creates a
hydrostatic skeleton and aids in locomotion.
Their elongated body is metamerically
segmented and the body surface is divided
into segment or metameres. Internally the
segments are divided from one another by
partitions called septa. This phenomenon
is known as **metamerism**. The longitudinal
and circular muscles in the body wall help
in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like Nereis
have lateral appendages called **parapodia**,
which help in swimming. Chitinous setae
in Earthworms, and suckers in Leech help
in locomotion. The circulatory system is of
closed type and the respiratory pigments
are **haemoglobin** and **chlorocruorin**.
Nervous system consists of paired ganglion
connected by the lateral nerves to the
double ventral nerve cord. They reproduce
sexually. Development is direct or indirect
and includes a **trochophore larva**. Some are
monoecious (earthworms) while some are
dioecious (Neries and Leech). (Figure 2.14)
Examples: Lampito mauritii
(earthworm), Neries (sand worm),
Hirudinaria (leech).

((Filariasis)) has been a major public
health problem in India next only to
malaria. The disease was recorded in
India as early as 6th century B.C. by
the famous Indian physician, Susruta
in his book **Susruta Samhita**. In 7 th
century A.D., **Madhavakara** described
signs and symptoms of the disese in
his treatise ‘ Madhava Nidhana’ which
holds good even today. In 1709, Clarke
identified elephantoid legs in Cochin.
The ((microfilariae)) in the peripheral
blood was first identified by Lewis in
1872 in Calcutta (Kolkata).

#### Phylum: Arthropoda
(G. arthros- jointed; podes- feet)

This is the largest phylum of the
Kingdom Animalia and includes the largest
class called **insecta** (total species ranges
from 2-10 million). They are bilaterally
symmetrical, segmented, triploblastic and
schizocoelomate animals with organ system
grade of body organisation. They have jointed
appendages which are used for locomotion,
feeding and are sensory in function. Body
is covered by chitinous exoskeleton for
protection and to prevent water loss, It is
shed off periodically by a process called
**moulting** or **ecdysis**. The body consists of
a head, thorax, and abdomen with a body
cavity called haemocoel. Respiratory organs
are gills, book gills, book lungs and trachea.
Circulatory system is of open type. Sensory
organs like antennae, eyes (compound
and simple), statocysts (organs of balance/
equilibrium) are present. Excretion takes
place through **malpighian tubules, green
glands, coxal glands**, etc. They are mostly
dioecious and oviparous; fertilization is
usually internal. Development may be direct
or indirect. Life history includes many larval
stages followed by metamorphosis.

Examples : Limulus (King crab, a living
fossil), Palamnaeus (Scorpion), Eupagarus
(Hermit crab), Apis (Honey bee), Musca
(House fly), Vectors- Anopheles, Culex, Aedes
(mosquitoes), Economically important insects
- Apis- (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silk worm),
Laccifer (Lac insects), Gregarious pest - Locusta
(Locust) (Figure 2.15)

Spider silk is five times stronger than
steel of the same diameter. It has been
suggested that a Boeing 747 could be
stopped in flight by a single pencil-
width strand and spider silk is almost
as strong as Kevlar, the toughest
man-made polymer.

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

#### Phylum: Mollusca
(L. molluscs –soft bodied)
This is the second largest animal
phylum. Molluscs are terrestrial and aquatic
(marine or fresh water) and exhibit organ
system level of body organisation. They are
bilaterally symmetrical (except univalves
eg. apple snail) triploblastic and coelomate
animals. Body is covered by a calcareous
shell and is unsegmented with a distinct
head, muscular foot and a visceral hump
or visceral mass. A soft layer of skin forms
a mantle over the visceral hump. The space
between the visceral mass and **mantle**
(pallium) is called the mantle cavity in which
a number of feather like gills (**ctenidia**) are
present, which are respiratory in function.
The digestive system is complete and mouth
contains a rasping organ called radula with
transverse rows of chitinous teeth for feeding
(radula is absent in bivalves). The sense
organs are tentacles, eyes and **osphraidium**
(to test the purity of water and present in
bivalves and gastropods). Excretory organs
are nephridia. Open type of circulatory
system is seen except for cephalopods such
as squids, cuttle fishes and octopus. Blood
contains **haemocyanin**, a copper containing
respiratory pigment. They are dioecious and
oviparous. Development is indirect with a
**veliger larva** (a modified trochophore larva).

Examples: Pila (Apple snail),
Lamellidens (Mussel), Pinctada (Pearl
oyster), Sepia (Cuttle fish), Loligo (Squid),
Octopus (Devil fish) (Figure 2.16).

**Marbled Cone Snail**
(Conus marmoreus)
This cone-shaped
snail can deliver
dangerous venom which may result in
vision loss, respiratory failure, muscle
paralysis and eventually death. There is
no anti-venom available.
{{< /box >}}

#### Phylum Echinodermata
(G. Echinos – spiny; dermos –skin)
All Echinoderms are marine animals.
The adults are **radially symmetrical** but the
larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. These
animals have a mesodermal endoskeleton
of calcareous ossicles and hence the name
Echinodermata (spiny skin). They are
exclusively marine with organ system
level of organisation. The most distinctive
feature of echinoderms is the presence of
the **water vascular system** or **ambulacral
system** with **tube feet** or **podia**, which
helps in locomotion, capture and transport
of food and respiration. The digestive
system is complete with mouth on ventral
side and anus on the dorsal side. Excretory
organs are absent. The nervous system and
sensory organs are poorly developed. The
circulatory system is open type without
heart and blood vessels. Sexes are separate.
Reproduction is sexual and fertilization
is external. Development is indirect with
free swimming bilaterally symmetrical
larval forms. Some echinoderms exhibit
autotomy with remarkable powers of
**regeneration**. e.g. Star fish. (Figure 2.17)

Examples: Asterias (Starfish or Sea
star), Echinus (Sea-urchin), Antedon (Sea-
lily), Cucumaria (Sea-cucumber), Ophiura
(Brittle star)

**Figure 2.17 Examples of Echinodermata**

![germinal-layers](/books/biology/unit-1/kingdom-animania/asymetric-in-sponges.png "kingdom animania")

#### Phylum: Hemichordata
(G.hemi –half; chorda-string)

Hemichordates were earlier
treated as a subphylum of Chordata (or
Prochordata). They are now regarded to be
an independent phylum of invertebrates,
close to Echinodermata. The animals
of this group possess the characters of
invertebrates as well as chordates.

This phylum consists of a small group
of worm-like, soft marine animals, mostly
tubiculous and commonly called the **‘acorn**
worms’ or ‘tongue worms’. They are
bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and
coelomate animals with organ system level
of organisation. Their body is cylindrical
and is divided into three regions, the anterior
proboscis, a short collar and a long trunk.
Most hemichordates are ciliary feeders.
Their circulatory system is simple
and open or lacune type with
a dorsal heart. Respiration
is through paired gill slits
opening into the pharynx.
Excretion is by a single
**proboscis gland** or
**glomerulus** situated in
the proboscis. Nervous
system is primitive.
Sexes are separate
and exhibit sexual
mode of reproduction;
Fertilization is
external. Development
is indirect with a free
swimming **tornaria larva**.
Examples: Balanoglossus, Saccoglossus,
Ptychodera flava (Indian Hemichordate
found in Kurusadai islands in Tamilnadu)
(Figure 2.18).

**Figure 2.18Example ofHemichordata -Balanoglossus**
